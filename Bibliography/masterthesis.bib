	abstract = {Modern robots are mainly controlled by monolithic black-box controllers provided by the individual manufacturers. In research institutions the first version of the Robot Operating System (ROS1) is widely used for different applications. However, ROS1 lacks real-time capable communication. The ongoing development of ROS2 promises to break this paradigm. By employing Data Distribution Service (DDS) as a middleware the modular architecture aims at providing realtime capabilities. This study assesses the current prospects and limitations of ROS2. It gains novel insights towards improved and, in particular, reliable results regarding latencies and jitter. To this end, the allocation and transmission of ROS2 messages is evaluated in an example application for robotic control. An oscilloscope is applied for external validation of the measurements in such a time-synchronized distributed network. The complete application is set up from non-real-time object detection towards real-time control via ROS2 and EtherCAT. An in-depth evaluation of the ROS2 communication stack on a single host and in distributed setups is included. With real-time safe memory allocation and highly privileged ROS2 processes real-time capabilities are ensured.},

	abstract = {Middleware for robotics development must meet demanding requirements in real-time distributed embedded systems. The Robot Operating System (ROS), open-source middleware, has been widely used for robotics applications. However, the ROS is not suitable for real-time embedded systems because it does not satisfy real-time requirements and only runs on a few OSs. To address this problem, ROS1 will undergo a significant upgrade to ROS2 by utilizing the Data Distribution Service (DDS). DDS is suitable for real-time distributed embedded systems due to its various transport configurations (e.g., deadline and fault-tolerance) and scalability. ROS2 must convert data for DDS and abstract DDS from its users; however, this incurs additional overhead, which is examined in this study. Transport latencies between ROS2 nodes vary depending on the use cases, data size, configurations, and DDS vendors. We conduct proof of concept for DDS approach to ROS and arrange DDS characteristic and guidelines from various evaluations. By highlighting the DDS capabilities, we explore and evaluate the potential and constraints of DDS and ROS2.},

	doi = {10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636590},
	abstract = {Robot Operating System (ROS) is a de-facto standard robot middleware in many academic and industrial use cases. However, utilizing ROS/ROS2 in safety-critical embedded applications with real-time requirement is challenging because of C1) Non-real-time underlying hardware, C2) No control on the host OS scheduler, C3) Unpredictable dynamic memory allocation, C4) High resource requirement, and C5) Unpredictable execution model for ROS nodes. In this paper, we address these limiting factors by proposing a hardwaresoftware architecture -CompROS- for ROS2 based robotic development in a Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) platform. The proposed hardware architecture consists of a Hard Real-Time (HRT) RISC-V based subsystem implemented in the Programmable Logic (PL) part of the MPSoC platform, a Soft Real-Time (SRT) ARM-based subsystem in the Processing System (PS) part of the MPSoC platform, and a Non-Real-Time (NRT) PC. While the proposed hardware architecture along with a partitioning layer overcomes the first two limiting factors, the rest are managed by the proposed multi-layer software architecture. We make a bare-metal implementation of XRCE-DDS standard for PL-PS communication, while peer-to-peer PL-PL communication is done through a proposed real-time publish-subscribe approach. The reliable communication for PS-PL communication is done through utilizing C-HEAP protocol. Further, we integrate ROS2 software layers on top of the proposed hardware and software layers. Finally, with respect to C5, we present a real-time execution model of ROS2 nodes by a mapping of ROS2 entities to CompROS entities, which is validated through experimental results. We run ROS2 middleware with an executable size of less than 200 KB on an MPSoC platform.},

Even in a myriad of applications and environments, there exists a common vocabulary of components that robots share—the need for a modular, scalable, and reliable architecture; sensing; planning; mobility; and autonomy. The Robot Operating System (ROS) was an integral part of the last chapter, demonstrably expediting robotics research with freely available components and a modular framework. However, ROS 1 was not designed with many necessary production-grade features and algorithms. ROS 2 and its related projects have been redesigned from the ground up to meet the challenges set forth by modern robotic systems in new and exploratory domains at all scales. In this Review, we highlight the philosophical and architectural changes of ROS 2 powering this new chapter in the robotics revolution. We also show through case studies the influence ROS 2 and its adoption has had on accelerating real robot systems to reliable deployment in an assortment of challenging environments.},

Properties such as security, liveness and priority of DDS in ROS2 were verified. The results show that the design satisfies these properties and high-priority messages can be sent and transmitted preferentially by the system.

Academia and industry have an urgent need for high-quality, high-stability, distributed and easy-to-operate control systems with the development of the robotics industry. Robot systems architecture based on ROS and ROS2 have attracted more and more attention due to the flexibility, openness, modularity, scalability and friendliness. The main contribution of this article is to partially construct the real-time architecture of the collaborative robot control system. In addition, the timing jitter of the system, EtherCAT master station and ROS under different frequencies and loads is analyzed. First, a Linux kernel based on PREEMPT\_RT patch is constructed, the basic architecture is described, and the timing performance of the robot system is improved through the application of high-precision timers, priority assignment, scheduling mode, and energy consumption management. Furthermore, the timing jitter performance of the operating system is analyzed. The maximum jitter of the system and the EtherCAT master station is about 10 us, and the average jitter is 1 us. Finally, the timing jitter of the built-in timing callbacks in ROS and ROS2 is evaluated. The design of the real-time system and performance analysis provide critical support for the design of the robot controller.},

Even having tools to implement internal real-time processing the system not ensure that the communication with other nodes will have real time constraints, once that we look for processing and not communication real-time. Real-time processing is an important component especially in Robotics where many applications require some data processing as it comes in, what means that they need processing with time requirements. The chapter shows some concepts, how the system was developed, how to implement it on the STM32F4 microcontroller and some tests to show its capabilities. The main system was developed under Ubuntu 16.04, with a STM32F4 microcontroller, and the portability test was made under Microsoft Windows 10, with a Texas Instruments LM3S Stellaris board.

	abstract = {Wireless communications offer significant benefits over wired communications, which has increased their popularity in industrial applications. Nevertheless, the existing wireless standard technologies do not satisfy the requirements demanded by the most critical industrial applications and thus, wired communications cannot be directly replaced by wireless solutions. Moreover, the inclusion of movable nodes in the network brings new challenges, such as the handover mechanism. In this paper, a hybrid wired/wireless architecture designed for industrial control applications is proposed. To control the wired network, a time-sensitive network (TSN) is used and to control the wireless network a medium access control (MAC) protocol is designed. In order to communicate both networks, a bridge that acts as a deterministic access point (AP) with real-time features is also proposed. One of the fundamental parts of the proposed architecture is that it can be used in applications with mobility requirements. Hence, a soft-handover algorithm is designed which guarantees uninterrupted communication during its execution without the need for a second radio interface and with reduced growth in network overhead. The proposed architecture is evaluated in order to assess its performance. This paper extends our previous work, including both a theoretical analysis to determine the delay bounds of the proposed architecture and a comparison between the performances of the proposed handover algorithm with other algorithms proposed in the literature. The evaluation has been carried out through OMNeT++ simulations. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed handover algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art solutions.},

A quality measure ‘interactivity’ is defined to compare such decompositions. The proposed method has many advantages (e.g. possibility of non-square controllers, provision to ensure controllability and observability, scalability, etc.) over existing approaches.

Their intrinsic features in geographic space and resources put forward to urgent requirements of reliability and scalability for designed filtering or control schemes. This paper presents a review of the state-of-the-art of distributed filtering and control of industrial CPSs described by differential dynamics models. Special attention is paid to sensor networks, manipulators, and power systems. For real-time monitoring, some typical Kalman-based distributed algorithms are summarized and their performances on calculation burden and communication burden, as well as scalability, are discussed in depth. Then, the characteristics of non-Kalman cases are further disclosed in light of constructed filter structures. Furthermore, the latest development is surveyed for distributed cooperative control of mobile manipulators and distributed model predictive control in industrial automation systems. By resorting to droop characteristics, representative distributed control strategies classified by controller structures are systematically summarized for power systems with the requirements of power sharing and voltage and frequency regulation. In addition, distributed security control of industrial CPSs is reviewed when cyber-attacks are taken into consideration. Finally, some challenges are raised to guide the future research.},

	abstract = {The design of humanoid robots naturally requires the simultaneous control of a high number of joints. Moreover, the performance of the overall robot is strongly determined by the low-level control system as all high-level software e.g. for locomotion planning and control is built on top of it. In order to achieve high update rates and high bandwidth for the joint control, an advanced real-time control system architecture is required. However, outdated communication protocols with associated limits in the achievable update rates are still used in nowadays humanoid robots. Moreover, the performance of the low-level control systems is not analyzed in detail or the systems rely on specialized hardware, which lacks reliability and persistence. We present a reliable and high-performance control system architecture for humanoid robots based on the ETHERCAT technology. To the authors' knowledge this is the only system, which operates at control rates beyond 2 khz and input/output latencies below 1 ms. Our control architecture includes a learning-based feedforward control strategy to improve joint tracking performance. The improved joint control method and the communication system are evaluated on our humanoid robot LOLA. Our software framework is available online to allow other researchers to benefit from our experiences.},

In this paper, a distributed control strategy is proposed for microgrid synchronization operation. The proposed controller design utilizes pinning-based consensus algorithm to avoid system single point of failure. It is able to actively track the main grid frequency, provide a good coordination between frequency and phase regulation and ensure all distributed generations in the system proportionally share the load. Implementation of such distributed algorithm in practice is difficult because it requires mitigation of both distributed computing and power system engineering challenges. In this paper, a novel software platform called RIAPS platform is presented that helps implementing the proposed distributed synchronization strategy in practical hardware controllers. The performance of the controllers are validated using a real-time controller hardware-in-the-loop microgrid testbed.},

According to the existing metallurgical industry control architecture, this paper proposes a structure of a metallurgical industry CCS. By analyzing the internal characteristics of the system, the system delay is decomposed into cloud delay and network delay, and the CCS time-delay model is obtained. Based on the established metallurgical industry CCS time-delay model, we design the delay controller by using state feedback and pole configuration methods, and propose a detailed internal structure model of the system. Finally, the typical links are simulated according to common signals in the metallurgical industry.

The proposed control strategy exploits a communication network to achieve proportional current sharing using a consensus-like algorithm. Voltage regulation is achieved by constraining the system to a suitable manifold. Two robust control strategies of sliding mode type are developed to reach the desired manifold in a finite time. The proposed control scheme is formally analyzed, proving the achievement of proportional current sharing, while guaranteeing that the weighted average voltage of the microgrid is identical to the weighted average of the voltage references.},

	abstract = {Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 is a ground-up re-design of ROS 1 to support performance critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs) using the Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware. Accordingly, the security of ROS 2 is highly reliant on the security of its DDS communication protocol. However, finding a balance between the performance and security is non-trivial task. Inappropriate security implementations may cause not only significant loss on performance of the system, but also security failures in the system. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the DDS security protocol as well as an overview on how to find the balance between performance and security. To accomplish this, we evaluate the latency and throughput of the communication protocols of ROS 2 in both wired and wireless networks, and measure the efficiency loss caused by the enabling of security protocols such as Virtual Private Network (VPN) and DDS security protocol in ROS 2 in both network setups. The result can be directly used by robotics developers to find the optimal and balanced settings of ROS 2 applications. Additionally, we analyzed the security specification of DDS using existing security standards and tested the implementation of the DDS protocol by performing static analysis. The results of this work can be used to enhance the security of ROS 2.},

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is commonly used for building autonomous robot systems.

In ROS 2, an Executor concept was introduced to support execution management and ensure real-time performance. However, it is difficult to improve the real-time performance of ROS 2. A real-time executor called the Callback-group-level Executor has been developed in micro-ROS. In this paper, the Callback-grouplevel Executor was used to replace the standard rclcpp Executor in ROS 2, and explore the resulting performance. Using the pingpong test bench, the potential and constraints of the real-time executor on ROS 2 were also examined and evaluated.},

	abstract = {Mobile communications have been undergoing a generational change every ten years or so. However, the time difference between the so-called “G's” is also decreasing. While fifth-generation (5G) systems are becoming a commercial reality, there is already significant interest in systems beyond 5G, which we refer to as the sixth generation (6G) of wireless systems. In contrast to the already published papers on the topic, we take a top-down approach to 6G. More precisely, we present a holistic discussion of 6G systems beginning with lifestyle and societal changes driving the need for next-generation networks. This is followed by a discussion into the technical requirements needed to enable 6G applications, based on which we dissect key challenges and possibilities for practically realizable system solutions across all layers of the Open Systems Interconnection stack (i.e., from applications to the physical layer). Since many of the 6G applications will need access to an order-of-magnitude more spectrum, utilization of frequencies between 100 GHz and 1 THz becomes of paramount importance. As such, the 6G ecosystem will feature a diverse range of frequency bands, ranging from below 6 GHz up to 1 THz. We comprehensively characterize the limitations that must be overcome to realize working systems in these bands and provide a unique perspective on the physical and higher layer challenges relating to the design of next-generation core networks, new modulation and coding methods, novel multiple-access techniques, antenna arrays, wave propagation, radio frequency transceiver design, and real-time signal processing. We rigorously discuss the fundamental changes required in the core networks of the future, such as the redesign or significant reduction of the transport architecture that serves as a major source of latency for time-sensitive applications. This is in sharp contrast to the present hierarchical network architectures that are not suitable to realize many of the anticipated 6G services. While evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of key candidate 6G technologies, we differentiate what may be practically achievable over the next decade, relative to what is possible in theory. Keeping this in mind, we present concrete research challenges for each of the discussed system aspects, providing inspiration for what follows.},

However, traditional packet networks can only reduce the end-to-end latencies to the order of tens of milliseconds. The IEEE 802.1 time sensitive networking (TSN) standard and related research studies have sought to provide link layer support for ULL networking, while the emerging IETF deterministic networking (DetNet) standards seek to provide the complementary network layer ULL support. This paper provides an up-to-date comprehensive survey of the IEEE TSN and IETF DetNet standards and the related research studies. The survey of these standards and research studies is organized according to the main categories of flow concept, flow synchronization, flow management, flow control, and flow integrity. ULL networking mechanisms play a critical role in the emerging fifth generation (5G) network access chain from wireless devices via access, backhaul, and core networks. We survey the studies that specifically target the support of ULL in 5G networks, with the main categories of fronthaul, backhaul, and network management. Throughout, we identify the pitfalls and limitations of the existing standards and research studies. This survey can thus serve as a basis for the development of standards enhancements and future ULL research studies that address the identified pitfalls and limitations.},

The proposed approach synchronizes and prioritizes the communication nodes, allowing it to transfer ultra-high three-phase sampled data and phasors. TSN is achieved by Quality of Service (QoS) profile software library. This allows control, monitoring, traffic scheduling, and prioritization. Some buses in a microgrid may have priority over others; and this can be prioritized at the data level too, where a part of the information is more critical than the others. The advantages of utilizing the TSN protocol on a microgrid with the approach proposed are: it is an alternative to GPS technology, three-phase data can be exchanged at much faster rate and data traffic in the network can be shaped with low packet loss, and low latency, in addition to providing interoperability through Data Distribution Services (DDS). These enhancements improve the communication reliability and enable distributed control, resulting in avoidance of any bottlenecks in the communications network. This proposed approach is implemented and demonstrated in a laboratory-scale microgrid. The results obtained, verify low latency and high throughput of the entire system while meeting the TSN and QoS requirements.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of a Multi-level Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) protocol based on a real-time communication platform utilizing Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware for data transfer of synchronous three phase measurement data. To transfer ultra-high three phase measurement samples, the DDS open-source protocol is exploited to shape the network's data traffic according to specific Quality of Service (QoS) profiles, leading to low packet loss and low latency by synchronizing and prioritizing the data in the network. Meanwhile the TSN protocol enables time-synchronization of the measured data by providing a common time reference to all the measurement devices in the network, making the system less expensive, more secure and enabling time-synchronization where acquiring GPS signals is a challenge. A software library was developed and used as a central Quality of Service (QoS) profile for the TSN implementation. The proposed design and implemented real-time simulation prototype presented in this paper takes in consideration diverse scenarios at multiple levels of prioritization including publishers, subscribers, and data packets. This allows granular control and monitoring of the data for traffic shaping, scheduling, and prioritization. The major strength of this protocol lies in the fact that it's not only in real time but it's time-critical too. The simulation prototype implementation was performed using the Real Time Innovation (RTI) Connext connectivity framework, custom-built MATLAB classes and DDS Simulink blocks. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol achieves low latency and high throughput, which makes it a desired option for various communication systems involved in microgrids, smart cities, military applications and potentially other time-critical applications, where GPS signals become vulnerable and data transfer needs to be prioritized.},

Due to the growing amount of network participants, smart sensors, and mixed-critical data, scalability and interoperability have become key factors of cost-efficient vehicle engineering. One solution to overcome these challenges is the AUTOSAR Adaptive software platform. Its service-oriented communication methodology allows a standardized data exchange that is not bound to a specific middleware protocol. OPC UA is a communication standard that is well-established in modern industrial automation. In addition to its Client–Server communication pattern, the newly released Publish–Subscribe (PubSub) architecture promotes scalability. PubSub is designed to work in conjunction with Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), a collection of standards that add real-time aspects to standard Ethernet networks. TSN allows services with different requirements to share a single physical network. In this paper, we specify an integration approach of AUTOSAR Adaptive, OPC UA, and TSN. It combines the benefits of these three technologies to provide deterministic high-speed communication. Our main contribution is the architecture for the binding between Adaptive Platform and OPC UA. With a prototypical implementation, we prove that a combination of OPC UA Client–Server and PubSub qualifies as a middleware solution for service-oriented communication in AUTOSAR.},

The book presents a broad set of tools for understanding coordination algorithms, determining their correctness, and assessing their complexity; and it analyzes various cooperative strategies for tasks such as consensus, rendezvous, connectivity maintenance, deployment, and boundary estimation. The unifying theme is a formal model for robotic networks that explicitly incorporates their communication, sensing, control, and processing capabilities--a model that in turn leads to a common formal language to describe and analyze coordination algorithms. Written for first- and second-year graduate students in control and robotics, the book will also be useful to researchers in control theory, robotics, distributed algorithms, and automata theory. The book provides explanations of the basic concepts and main results, as well as numerous examples and exercises.

In this way, properties for the design of flexible control architectures like modularity, fault-tolerance, integrability and extendibility are easily obtained; furthermore, it is possible to use the concepts of distributed knowledge and decentralized world representation. On the other hand, coordination between the components, e.g. path planning for collision avoidance between both manipulators in a two-arm system, is very difficult to guarantee. To explain these concepts, the Karlsruhe Autonomous Mobile Robot (KAMRO), which is being developed at our institute, is considered. The robot system consists of several subcomponents like two manipulators, hand-eye cameras, one overhead camera and a mobile platform. Extensions to the distributed control architecture KAMARA (KArlsruhe Multi-Agent Robot Architecture) are described that are used to overcome coordination problems, e.g. as caused by the independent task execution of both manipulator systems. Furthermore, we explain in which way the decentralized world representation can be used for parallel task execution. The intelligent control architecture described is used to replace the former control architecture of the autonomous robot KAMRO. The advantages of distributed control systems will be summarized through the actual implementation of the architecture to the robot KAMRO.},

A demonstration is presented that suggests that the approach scales to the complexity of manipulation tasks. The compact control basis representation and the predictable behavior of the constituent controllers greatly enhances the construction of correct composition policies. This predictability allows reasoning about end to end problem solving behavior, which is not supported by methods employing less formal behavioral specifications. In those methods the designer must determine the composition policy, or the system must find it through random exploration. Our approach opens the composition problem to a large variety of control, planning, and machine learning methods. We are investigating formal methods that automatically generate composition policies from abstract task descriptions provided by the user. The generic character of the control basis not only improves generalization across task domains, but also appears to improve generalization across a variety of hardware platforms.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In recent years self-reconfigurable modular robots have gained increasing interest from part of the international robotic community. Although recent robots of this type are characterized by advanced electro-mechanical designs, the development of their supporting control techniques have only registered strong results in the field of locomotion problems, while the manipulation capabilities of existing systems still appear to be quite limited. Aiming to provide a contribution along this latter direction, in this paper we propose a computationally distributed technique for controlling the motion of any tree-structured chain resulting from reconfiguration in its operational space. The presented strategy, which could actually be adopted when dealing with any kind of chain-based modular robotic system, turns out to be particularly well suited to self-reconfigurable structures for three main reasons: (i) it is not based on any explicit role assignment; all of the modules can be added, removed or exchanged online as required, with no impact on the overall control architecture; (ii) each module has only a very limited set of local information that must be known a priori and can be totally unaware of the remaining part of the chain; (iii) no external centralized controller is necessary; basic local processing and communication units onboard every module and a simple man—machine interface providing high-level commands are enough. A global self-coordinating behavior is automatically exhibited by the proposed technique at power-on or immediately after any configuration change as the result of a number of repeated data exchanges, performed online along the chain at every sampling interval. Although achievable performances depend on the available communication bandwidth, the convergence towards a final position error of zero is, however, always guaranteed. Moreover, because the computational burden required by every module is extremely light, the proposed technique represents an effective control solution that can be easily implemented onboard many of the low-cost and small control platforms available on existing self-reconfigurable robots.},

	isbn = {978-0-7923-7728-3},
	abstract = {Distributed manipulation effects motion on objects through a large number of points of contact. The primary benefit of distributed manipulators is that many small inexpensive mechanisms can move and transport large heavy objects. In fact, each individual component is simple, but their combined effect is quite powerful. Furthermore, distributed manipulators are fault-tolerant because if one component breaks, the other components can compensate for the failure and the whole system can still perform its task. Finally, distributed manipulators can perform a variety of tasks in parallel.  Distributed manipulation can be performed by many types of mechanisms at different scales. Due to the recent advances of MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical system) technology, it has become feasible to quickly manufacture distributed micro-manipulators at low cost. One such system is an actuator array where hundreds of micro-scaled actuators transport and manipulate small objects that rest on them. Macroscopic versions of the actuator array have also been developed and analyzed. Another form of distributed manipulation is derived from a vibrating plate, and teams of mobile robots have been used to herd large objects into desired locations.  There are many fundamental issues involved in distributed manipulation. Since a distributed manipulator has many actuators, distributed control strategies must be considered to effectively manipulate objects. A basic understanding of contact analysis between the actuators and object must also be considered. When each actuator in the array has a sensor, distributed sensing presents some basic research challenges. Distributed computation and communication are key issues to enable the successful deployment of distributed manipulators into use. Finally, the trade-off in centralized and de-centralized approaches in all of these algorithms must be investigated.},

With manipulability optimization incorporated in the proposed scheme, all the involved manipulators can be regulated to track their optimal configurations dynamically, in addition to the collaboration among them to complete the specified tasks. To do this, the distributed scheme is transformed into a dynamic quadratic programming (QP) problem by considering the time dependence of the parameters. Then, a generalized recurrent neural network (GRNN) is constructed and proposed to deal with the QP problem online with perturbations considered. Theoretical analysis is conducted, which confirms that the proposed GRNN is able to globally converge to the optimal solution to the dynamic QP problem in the presence of noises and perturbations. Finally, simulation results based on a distributed network of redundant robots are conducted and presented to verify the superior performance of the proposed distributed manipulability optimization scheme.},

Moreover, from the perspective of game theory, this article formulates the problem into a Nash equilibrium. Then, a neural network with anti-noise ability is constructed to seek and approximate the optimal strategy profile of the Nash equilibrium problem with time-varying parameters.

To achieve cooperative task allocation in a distributed way, an adaptation-based estimation law is established for each robotic agent to estimate the desired local trajectory. In addition, wrench synthesis is analyzed in detail to lay a solid foundation for tight cooperation tasks. Together with the estimated task, a set of distributed adaptive (DA) controllers is proposed to achieve motion synchronization of the mobile manipulator ensemble over a directed graph with a spanning tree irrespective of the kinematic and dynamic uncertainties in both the mobile manipulators and the tightly grasped object. The controlled synchronization alleviates the performance degradation caused by the estimation/tracking discrepancy during the transient phase. The proposed scheme requires no persistent excitation condition and avoids the use of noisy Cartesian-space velocities. Furthermore, it is independent from the object's center of mass by employing formation-based task allocation and a task-oriented strategy. These attractive attributes facilitate the practical application of the scheme. It is theoretically proven that convergence of the cooperative task tracking error is guaranteed. Simulation results, as well as manipulation experiments with three mobile manipulators involved, validate the efficacy and demonstrate the expected performance of the proposed scheme.},

This work combines distributed k WTA competition network with time delay for the first time, thus enabling it to better handle realistic applications than previous work. In addition, it theoretically derives the maximum delay allowed by the network and proves the convergence and robustness of the network. The results are applied to a multirobot system to conduct its robots’ competitive coordination to complete the given task.},

Unlike the traditional formation tracking problems with only cooperative interactions, solving the LBFT problem implies that: 1) the robots of the NRS are divided into two complementary subgroups according to the signed graph, describing the coexistence of cooperative and antagonistic interactions; 2) the states of each subgroup form a desired geometric pattern asymptotically in the local coordinate; and 3) the geometric center of each subgroup is forced to track the same leader trajectory with different plus–minus signs and a time lag. A new hierarchical control algorithm is designed to address this challenging problem. Based on the Lyapunov stability argument and the property of the matrix-weighted Laplacian, some sufficient criteria are derived for solving the LBFT problem. Finally, simulation examples are proposed to validate the effectiveness of the main results.},

Specifically, the robotic systems subject to nonholonomic constraints and dynamics are first transformed into a Euler-Lagrange-like model. By exploring the bearing-rigid graph theory, a backstepping approach is used to design the distributed formation controller. Simulations for 3-D robotics are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control law.

Different from the previous works of heterogeneous MASs, the agents in this study are considered to have different first-, second-, or even higher-order nonlinear dynamics. It means that, according to different tasks and situations, the following agents can have nonidentical orders or different numbers of states to be synchronized, which is more general for the practical cooperative applications. The leader is a higher-order nonautonomous system and contains full state information to be synchronized for all agents with mixed-order dynamics. Accordingly, the spanning tree is defined based on the specific state rather than on the agent to guarantee that each following agent can receive adequate state information. Distributed control protocols are designed for all agents to achieve the ultimate state synchronization to the leader in finite time. The Lyapunov approach is used for the stability analysis and a practical example of mixed-order mechanical MASs verifies the effectiveness and performance of the proposed distributed control protocols.},

The stability analysis is given based on an appropriate Lyapunov function and the distributed control problem is theoretically solved by the designed control algorithm. The Zeno behavior of the designed dynamic event-triggered method is excluded in a finite-time interval. Compared to some existing results for the event-triggered control of networked Euler–Lagrange systems, these event-triggered methods can be seen as the special cases of the dynamic event-triggered method proposed in this article. Simulation results based on UR5 robots of V-rep show that the proposed method can provide an increase (4.46 ± 3.36\%) of the average lengths of event intervals compared to the one of the existing event-triggered methods, which leads to a lower usage of the communication resource.

In this article, an adaptive impedance controller for human–robot co-transportation is put forward in task space. Vision and force sensing are employed to obtain the human hand position, and to measure the interaction force between the human and the robot. Using the latest developments in nonlinear control theory, we propose a robot end-effector controller to track the motion of the human partner under actuators’ input constraints, unknown initial conditions, and unknown robot dynamics. The proposed adaptive impedance control algorithm offers a safe interaction between the human and the robot and achieves a smooth control behavior along the different phases of the co-transportation task.

Further automation, development, and activation of such systems require cooperation among heterogeneous robots. Classical control theory is inefficient in managing large-scale complex dynamic systems. Therefore, a discrete-event system based on the supervisory control theory must be introduced to overcome this limitation. In this article, we propose a hybrid system-based hierarchical control architecture using a supervisory control-based high-level controller and a traditional control-based low-level controller. The hybrid system and its dynamics are modeled through a formal method, called hybrid automata, and the behavior specifications are designed to express the control objectives for cooperation. In addition, modular supervisors that are more scalable and maintainable than a centralized supervisory controller were synthesized. The proposed hybrid system and hierarchical control architecture were implemented, validated, and evaluated for performance through a physics-based simulator and field tests. The experimental results confirmed that the robot team satisfied the given specifications and presented systematic results, validating the efficiency of the proposed control architecture.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical frameworks—a special class of directed frameworks with a layer-by-layer architecture—can be an effective mechanism to coordinate robot swarms. Their effectiveness was recently demonstrated by the mergeable nervous systems paradigm (Mathews et al., 2017), in which a robot swarm can switch dynamically between distributed and centralized control depending on the task, using self-organized hierarchical frameworks. New theoretical foundations are required to use this paradigm for formation control of large swarms. In particular, the systematic and mathematically analyzable organization and reorganization of hierarchical frameworks in a robot swarm is still an open problem. Although methods for framework construction and formation maintenance via rigidity theory exist in the literature, they do not address cases of hierarchy in a robot swarm. In this article, we extend bearing rigidity to directed topologies and extend the Henneberg constructions to generate self-organized hierarchical frameworks with bearing rigidity. We investigate three-key self-reconfiguration problems: 1) framework merging; 2) robot departure; and 3) framework splitting. We also derive the mathematical conditions of these problems and then develop algorithms that preserve rigidity and hierarchy using only local information. Our approach can be used for formation control generally, as in principle it can be coupled with any control law that makes use of bearing rigidity. To demonstrate and validate our proposed hierarchical frameworks and methods, we apply them to four scenarios of reactive formation control using an example control law.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of coordinated path tracking for networked nonholonomic mobile vehicles, while building and keeping a desired formation. The control laws proposed are categorized into two envelopes by integrating individual path tracking and global virtual structure approaches. One is steering individual vehicles to track virtual vehicles moving along predefined paths, generated by a formation reference vehicle (FRV) of a time-varying desired virtual structure. The other is ensuring paths to be well tracked in order to build a geometric formation, through the distributed feedback law for path parameters related to the virtual vehicles, such that the physical vehicles are on the desired placements of the formation structure. Within this framework, geometric path tracking is achieved via nonlinear control theory, where an approaching angle is injected as a heading guidance design. The distributed feedback law is analyzed under communication constraints using algebraic graph theory. It is formally shown that the path tracking error of each vehicle is reduced to zero, and vehicles in the networked team globally asymptotically converge to a desired formation with equal path parameters. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control design.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a fully distributed control protocol that achieves time-varying group formation tracking for linear multiagent systems connected via a directed graph. The group formation tracking often leads to sub-formations especially when the leaders are placed far apart or they have separate control inputs. In the proposed approach, the followers are distributed into several subgroups and each subgroup attains the predefined subformation along with encompassing the leaders. Each subgroup can be assigned multiple leaders, contrary to the single-leader case considered in most existing literature, which makes the current problem nontrivial. When multiple leaders exist in a subgroup, the subformation attained by that subgroup keeps tracking a convex combination of the states of the leaders. A distributed adaptive control protocol has been introduced in this paper which uses only relative state information and, thus, avoids direct computation of the graph Laplacian matrix. Due to the virtue of this, the proposed scheme remains effective even when some of the agents get disconnected from the network due to sudden communication failure. An algorithm is provided to outline the steps to design the control law to attain time-varying group formation tracking with multiple leaders. Toward the end, a case study on multitarget surveillance operation is taken up to show an important application of the proposed adaptive control technique.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the synchronization of multiple memristive neural networks (MMNNs) under cyber-physical attacks through distributed event-triggered control. In the field of multi-agent dynamics, memristive neural network (MNN) is considered as a kind of switched systems because of its state-dependent parameters which can lead to the parameters mismatch during synchronization. This will increase the uncertainty of the system and affect the theoretical analysis. Also, neural network is considered as a typical nonlinear system. Therefore, the model studied in this paper is a nonlinear system with switching characteristics. In complex environments, MMNNs may receive mixed attacks, one of which is called cyber-physical attacks that may influence both communication links and MNN nodes to cause changes in topology and physical state. To tackle this issue, we construct a novel Lyapunov functional and use properties of M-matrix to get the criteria for synchronization of MMNNs under cyber-physical attacks. It is worth mentioning that the controllers in this paper are designed to be distributed under event-triggering conditions and Zeno behavior is also excluded. In addition, the algorithm of parameter selection is given to help designing the controllers. One example is given at the end of the paper to support our results.},

Although some studies on the multimanipulator system share the load of the control center by transforming the network topology, the whole system often suffers an increased communication burden. In this article, a multimanipulator cooperative control scheme with an improved communication efficiency is proposed to allocate limited communication resources reasonably. The entire control process is formulated from the perspective of the game theory, and finally, evolved into a problem of finding a Nash equilibrium with time-varying parameters. Then, a neural network solver is designed to update the strategies of manipulators. Theoretical analysis supports the convergence and robustness of the solver. In addition, Zeno behavior does not occur under the domination of the control strategy. Finally, simulative results reveal that the proposed control strategy has advantages over the traditional periodic control in communication.},

In many real practical systems, owing to communication limits and the vulnerability of communication networks to be overheard and modified by the adversary, consideration of communication delays and cyber-attacks in designing of the controller is important. To consider these challenges, in the presented approach, a distributed controller for a group of one-link flexible joint manipulators is provided which are connected via data delaying communication network in the presence of cyber-attacks. Sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee that the closed-loop system is stable with prescribed disturbance attenuation, and the parameter of the control law can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequities (LMIs). Eventually, simulations results of four single-link manipulators are provided to demonstrate the performance of the introduced method.},

The cane-type walking support robot moved in response to the manipulation force applied to the robot by the user, and can realize walking/movement support in all directions through the omnidirectional traveling part. In addition, the height of the robot can be adjusted according to the user’s physique, and the motion characteristics can be set according to the user’s walking ability. The wheelchair robot has a seat that can be raised, lowered, and tilted to provide standing assistance for the user and mobility support as an electric wheelchair.

This leaves automation engineers wishing to apply the concept at a loss, as they must construct a digital twin from a conceptual level with little to no guidelines. To help the adoption of the digital twin concept, a general architecture that may be tuned to the needs of the physical application is required.Within this paper, we propose an architecture for digital twins in IEC61499 based distributed control systems. Using this architecture, we construct the model based on known physics and sensor data to be used in the digital twin for simulation purposes. This demonstrates itself as an effective method for constructing the model of a digital twin for the purposes of dynamic simulation and control. With this base architecture in place, we may now work towards expanding the capability of the set-up to that of a full digital twin.},

Single robotic platforms, such as the Sojourner rover successfully flown in 1997 and the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) which landed on Mars in January of 2004, have neither the autonomy, mobility, nor manipulation capabilities for such ambitious undertakings. One possible approach to these future missions is the fielding of cooperative multi-robot systems that have the required onboard control algorithms to more or less autonomously perform tightly coordinated tasks. These control algorithms must operate under the constrained mass, volume, processing, and communication conditions that are present on NASA planetary surface rover systems. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of distributed control algorithms that build on our earlier development of an enabling architecture called CAMPOUT (Control Architecture for Multi-robot Planetary Outposts). We also report on some ongoing physical experiments in tightly coupled distributed control at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, CA where in the first study two rovers acquire and carry an extended payload over uneven, natural terrain, and in the second three rovers form a team for cliff access.},

Such systems have many redundant degrees of freedom in order to meet the combined demands of strength, rigidity, workspace kinematics, reconfigurability, and fault tolerance. In order to implement these new generations of robotic system, new approaches must be considered for design, analysis, and control. This paper presents an efficient distributed computational scheme which computes the kinematics, dynamics, redundancy resolution, and control inputs for real-time application to the control of the Tetrobot modular reconfigurable robots. The entire system is decomposed into subsystems based on a modular approach and Newton's equations of motion are derived and implemented using a recursive propagation algorithm. Two different dynamic resolution of redundancy schemes, the centralized Jacobian method and the distributed virtual force method, are proposed to optimize the actuating forces. Finally, distributed dynamic control algorithms provide an efficient modular implementation of the control architecture for a large family of configurations.},

The complete distributed control framework is implemented with the combination of a fast model predictive control method executed at 50 Hz on low-power computers onboard multirotor UAVs and validated via a series of hardware-in-the-loop simulations and real-robot experiments. The experiments are configured to study the control performance in various formation cases of arbitrary time-varying (e.g., expanding, shrinking, or moving) shapes. In the actual experiments, up to four multirotors have been implemented to form arbitrary triangular, rectangular, and circular shapes drawn by the operator via a human-robot interaction device.

The UHV multi-split transmission line power cable operation robot is an important equipment to ensure the reliable operation of high voltage lines and is a useful exploration to realize high-quality power transmission. As the robot system platform equipment mature and operation environment gradually become more complex, the double arm coordination motion control in extreme environment becomes one of the main bottleneck for its practical in power system. Design/methodology/approach This paper summarizes the key technologies related to power cable robots, and aims at key technical indicators such as operation reliability, operation efficiency and operation quality in the robot’s practical process. The dynamic evolution mechanism of the robot’s mechanical configuration, the multi-physics information fusion algorithm in extreme environments, the robot’s autonomous positioning and its error compensation control, the robot’s robust motion control in extreme environments and the dual-arm force-position hybrid coordination control and the dynamic distribution and elimination mechanism of internal forces in the closed chain between robots and operating objects, all the research methods and solutions of the key technologies are proposed, respectively. Findings Finally, a new control architecture for power cable robots in the background of the Ubiquitous Power Internet of Things is proposed so as to manage the operation and maintenance of electric power systems. The above key technologies are a new exploration of the operation and maintenance management of EHV (Extra High Voltage) multi-split transmission lines which have laid a solid theoretical foundation for the power cable robot. Originality/value High voltage transmission line is the main channel of power transmission. It is an important means to improve the integration of operation and maintenance management of power system to use robot instead of manual inspection and maintenance of power line, in the promotion and application of electric robot. The authors pay attention to the practicability, and the breakthrough of key technologies of robot is the premise of the practicability of robot. In this paper, the robot operation and control in multi-task and complex scenes are studied. The research and implementation of the main key technologies, such as the dynamic evolution mechanism of robot configuration, the coupling and fusion law of multi physical fields in the extreme electric power environment, the autonomous positioning control of manipulator, the robust control of robot in the super electromagnetic field environment and the cooperative operation control of multi manipulator, are discussed.},

To avoid damages to living cells caused by illuminating laser directly on them, microrobots controlled by OT can be used for manipulation of cells or living organisms in microscopic scale. Translation and planar rotation motion of microrobots can be realized by using a multi-spot planar OT. However, out-of-plane manipulation of microrobots is difficult to achieve with a planar OT. This paper presents a distributed manipulation scheme based on multiple laser spots, which can control the out-of-plane pose of a microrobot along multiple axes. Different microrobot designs have been investigated and fabricated for experimental validation. The main contributions of this paper include: i) development of a generic model for the structure design of microrobots which enables multi-dimensional (6D) control via conventional multi-spot OT; ii) introduction of the distributed force control for microrobot manipulation based on characteristic distance and power intensity distribution. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its potential applications, which include indirect manipulation of micro-objects.},

Managing such a system with respect to the startup of processes, internal communications and state changes quickly becomes a very complex task. The paper presents a distributed control architecture which supports a formal model of computation as described by Lyons and Arib (1989). The architecture is primarily intended for robot control but has a wide range of potential applications. We motivate the design and implementation of the architecture by discussing the desired properties of a robot system capable of doing real-time tasks like manipulation. This leads to functionality such as a process algebra controlling the life-cycle of the processes, grouping and distribution of processes and internal communication transparent to location. Our implementation does not in itself introduce any bottlenecks due to a tree structure with local control over processes which gives an efficient and scalable architecture. At the end, an example scenario in which a fairly advanced problem like opening a door using a mobile robot with a manipulator arm is demonstrated in the presented framework.},

The OMG DDS attempts to unify the common practice of several existing implementations [2, 5] enumerating and providing formal definitions for the QoS (Quality of Service) settings that can be used to configure the service. This paper introduces the OMG DDS specification, describes the main aspects of the model, QoS settings, and gives examples of the communication scenarios it supports.},

In research institutions the first version of the Robot Operating System (ROS1) is widely used for different applications. However, ROS1 lacks real-time capable communication. The ongoing development of ROS2 promises to break this paradigm. By employing Data Distribution Service (DDS) as a middleware the modular architecture aims at providing realtime capabilities. This study assesses the current prospects and limitations of ROS2. It gains novel insights towards improved and, in particular, reliable results regarding latencies and jitter. To this end, the allocation and transmission of ROS2 messages is evaluated in an example application for robotic control. An oscilloscope is applied for external validation of the measurements in such a time-synchronized distributed network. The complete application is set up from non-real-time object detection towards real-time control via ROS2 and EtherCAT. An in-depth evaluation of the ROS2 communication stack on a single host and in distributed setups is included. With real-time safe memory allocation and highly privileged ROS2 processes real-time capabilities are ensured.},

	abstract = {It is no secret that robotic systems are expanding into many human roles or are augmenting human roles. The Robot Operating System is an open-source standard for the robotic industry that enables locomotion, manipulation, navigation, and recognition tasks by integrating sensors, motors, and controllers into reusable modules over a distributed messaging architecture. As reliance on robotic systems increases, these systems become high value targets, for example, in autonomous vehicles where human life is at risk. As Robot Operating System has become a de facto standard for many robotic systems, the security of Robot Operating System becomes an important consideration for deployed systems. The original Robot Operating System implementations were not designed to mitigate the security risks associated with hostile actors. Robot Operating System 2, the next generation of the Robot Operating System, addresses this shortcoming, leveraging Data Distributed Services for its messaging architecture and Data Distributed Services security extension for its data protection in motion. This article provides a systematic review of Robot Operating System 2 and identifies potential risks for this new robotic system paradigm. A Robot Operating System 2 robotic system is viewed as a series of layers from the hardware that include sensors, motors, and controllers to the software layers, which include the operating system, security services, protocols, messaging, and the cognitive layer for observation, learning, and action. Since Robot Operating System 2 and security are new considerations for robotics systems as they move into mainstream, many questions emerge. For example, can some portions be secure and other portions be non-secure? Does everything need to be secure? What are the trade-offs between, security, performance, latency and throughput? What about real-time robotic systems? This article provides an overview of the Robot Operating System 2 paradigm and represents a first step toward answering these questions.},

Although the legacy protocols are still persistent in the industry, the transition was initiated by the key Industry 4.0 facilitating protocol, the Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA). OPC UA has to reach the envisioned applicability, and it therefore has to consider coexistence with other emerging real-time oriented protocols in the production lines. The Data Distribution Service (DDS) will certainly be present in future architectures in some areas as robots, co-bots, and compact units. The current paper proposes a solution to evaluate the real-time coexistence of OPC UA and DDS protocols, functioning in parallel and in a gateway context. The purpose is to confirm the compatibility and feasibility between the two protocols alongside a general definition of criteria and expectations from an architectural point of view, pointing out advantages and disadvantages in a neutral manner, shaping a comprehensive view of the possibilities. The researched architecture is meant to comply with both performance comparison scenarios and interaction scenarios over a gateway application. Considering the industrial tendencies, the developed solution is applied using non-ideal infrastructures to provide a more feasible and faster applicability in the production lines.},

	abstract = {Robotic systems are typically subject to real-time constraints. Still, the ROS ecosystem-the most popular repository of open-source robotics software-exhibits little evidence of the use of real-time theory to bound or control worst-case response times. Hurdles to adoption are the amount of expertise required to correctly use real-time scheduling mechanisms and the inherent unpredictability of typical robotics workloads, which defy static provisioning. To overcome these hurdles, ROS-Llama, an automatic latency manager for ROS2, is proposed. Crucially, use of ROS-Llama requires only little effort and knowledge of realtime concepts. Relevant properties of ROS2 and essential requirements of the robotics domain are identified, and the conceptual and practical challenges in developing such a mostly automatic tool are discussed. Experiments on a mobile robot demonstrate the viability of the approach and show that ROS-Llama reduces the maximum observed latency under load compared to the default Linux scheduler. Finally, open problems in the underlying real-time analysis and major platform limitations in Linux and ROS2 that prevent further improvements are identified.},

	abstract = {ROS (Robot Operating System) is currently the most popular robotic software development framework. Robotic software in safe-critical domain are usually subject to hard real-time constraints, so designers must formally model and analyze their timing behaviors to guarantee that real-time constraints are always honored at runtime. This paper studies real-time scheduling and analysis of processing chains in ROS2, the second-generation ROS with a major consideration of real-time capability. First, we study response time analysis of processing chains on ROS2 executors. We show that the only existing result of this problem is both optimistic and pessimistic, and develop new techniques to address these problems and significantly improve the analysis precision. Second, we reveal that the response time of a processing chain on an executor only depends on its last scheduling entity (callback), which provides useful guidance for designers to improve not only the response time bound, but also the actual worst-case/average response time of the system at little design cost. We conduct experiments with both randomly generated workload and a case study on realistic ROS2 platforms to evaluate and demonstrate our results.},

Due to the availability of information from sensors networks, an auto response can take place by alarms supervised by Decision Maker unit. Remote decisions can be made in a medical center after receiving inputs generated inside an ambulance.

SPARTA offers a very modular and fine-grained architecture, which is generic enough to serve a variety of AO systems. It includes the definitions of all the interfaces between those modules and provides libraries and tools for their implementation and testing, as well as a mapping to technologies capable of delivering the required performance. These comprise, amongst others, VXS communication, FPGA-aided wavefront processing, command time filtering and I/O, DSP-based wavefront reconstruction, DDS data distribution and multi-CPU number crunching, most of them innovative with respect to ESO standards in use. A scaled-down version of the platform, namely SPARTA-Light, will employ a subset of the SPARTA technologies to implement the AO modules for the VLT auxiliary telescopes (NAOMI) and is the baseline for a new VLTI instrument (GRAVITY). For the above instrument portfolio, SPARTA provides also a complete implementation of the AO application, with features customised to each instrument's needs and specific algorithms. In this paper we describe the architecture of SPARTA, its technology choices, functional units and test tools. End-to-end as well as individual module performance data is provided for the XAO system delivered to SPHERE.

Unlike traditional client-server communication models, DDS is based on the publish/subscribe communication model. DDS improves video streaming quality through its efficient and high-performance data delivery mechanism. This paper studies and investigates how DDS is suitable for streaming real-time full-motion video over a communication network. Experimental studies are conducted to compare video streaming using a the VLC player with the DDS overlay. Our results depict the superiority of DDS in provisioning quality video streams at the cost of low network bandwidth. The results also show that DDS is more scalable and flexible and is a promised technology for video distribution over IP networks where it uses much less bandwidth while maintaining high quality video stream delivery.},

However, deploying and managing large-scale distributed DDS applications is tedious and laborious. As a successful container orchestration platform for distributed applications in the cloud, Kubernetes (k8s) is a promising solution for DDS-based systems. However, the feasibility of running DDS applications in a k8s environment, and the overhead of different k8s virtualization network architectures on DDS application performance has not been systematically studied. To address this, we compare the performance of DDS applications with several k8s network solutions using a comprehensive set of experiments we designed for a DDS benchmark application. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) the overhead of container virtualization is trivial for DDS applications; (2) the overhead imposed by virtual networks is not significant and there is not much performance difference between the experimented virtual networking solutions; (3) WeaveNet is useful for DDS discovery because it supports IP multicast, but its multicast performance is considerably lower than the host network.},

Communication synchronization, dependability, and minimal communication jitter are major simulation and system issues for the time-based physics-based ROS simulator, event-based network-based wireless simulator, and complex dynamics of mobile and heterogeneous IoT devices deployed in actual environments. Simulating a heterogeneous multi-robot system before deployment is difficult due to synchronizing physics (robotics) and network simulators. Due to its master-based architecture, most TCP/IP-based synchronization middlewares use ROS1. A real-time ROS2 architecture with masterless packet discovery synchronizes robotics and wireless network simulations. A velocity-aware Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) technique for ground and aerial robots using Data Distribution Service (DDS) publish-subscribe transport minimizes packet loss, synchronization, transmission, and communication jitters. Gazebo and NS-3 simulate and test. Simulator-agnostic middleware. LOS/NLOS and TCP/UDP protocols tested our ROS2-based synchronization middleware for packet loss probability and average latency. A thorough ablation research replaced NS-3 with EMANE, a real-time wireless network simulator, and masterless ROS2 with master-based ROS1. Finally, we tested network synchronization and jitter using one aerial drone (Duckiedrone) and two ground vehicles (TurtleBot3 Burger) on different terrains in masterless (ROS2) and master-enabled (ROS1) clusters. Our middleware shows that a large-scale IoT infrastructure with a diverse set of stationary and robotic devices can achieve low-latency communications (12\% and 11\% reduction in simulation and real) while meeting mission-critical application reliability (10\% and 15\% packet loss reduction) and high-fidelity requirements.},

However, the communication of existing DDS middlewares generally relies on the network stacks of the operating system, which brings long latency to the real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a DPDK-based DDS, dubbed 3DS, to improve the performance of communication of DDS middlewares. First, 3DS reduces the latency of communication between distributed real-time applications by avoiding the latency of kernel. Second, 3DS reduces the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation by a reserved memory pool. Finally, 3DS adopts a thread-exclusive CPU model to reduce the resource contention between threads. We implement and evaluate 3DS on real systems running Linux. The experimental results show that 3DS reduces 44\% of the communication latency over FastDDS, which is the state-of-the-art DDS middleware used by ROS2. Moreover, the throughput of data transfer in 3DS can be 1.51 times that of FastDDS.},

	abstract = {The growing number of data- and latency-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications is posing significant challenges for the edge and cloud deployment of publish/subscribe services, which are required by these applications. Two independently developed technologies show promise in addressing these challenges. First, Kubernetes (K8s) provides a de-facto standard for container orchestration that can manage and scale distributed applications in the cloud. Second, OMG's Data Distribution Service (DDS), a standardized real-time, data-centric and peer-to-peer publish/subscribe middleware, is being used in thousands of critical systems around the world. However, the feasibility of running DDS applications within K8s for latency-sensitive edge computing, and specifically the performance overhead of K8s' network virtualization on DDS applications is not yet well-understood. To address this, in this paper we evaluate the performance overhead of several container network interface (CNI) plugins including Flannel, WeaveNet and Kube-Router installed on a hybrid (ARM+AMD) edge/cloud K8s cluster. The paper reports results from a comprehensive set of experiments conducted to measure and analyze the performance (throughput, latency, and CPU/memory usage) of containerized DDS applications from the perspectives of virtualization overhead, reliability (DDS Reliable and BestEffort QoS), transport mechanisms (UDP unicast and multicast), and security. The insights derived from this study provide concrete guidance to developers of DDS-based applications in choosing the right virtual network plugin and configurations when hosting their real-time IoT applications in real-world containerized environments.},

	abstract = {The military deploys many Internet of Things (IoT) in battlefield operations to provide information on terrain and enemy combatants. It also deploys automated robots or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) where securing and trusting collected data is essential. Choosing the middleware that handles this message transfer is crucial for real-time operations. Networks with multiple entities, including IoT devices, UAVs, and small computers, require robust middleware facilitating message sending in real-time. Ideally, the middleware would provide Quality of Service (QoS) to handle lost packets and retransmissions in lossy environments, especially between low-power machines. Data Distribution Service (DDS) is a middleware that implements real-time and QoS capabilities by sending messages, not based on endpoints but topics. However, DDS nodes are susceptible to impersonation attacks, which compromise integrity and trust. To mitigate these attacks, DDS-Cerberus (DDS-C) is developed as a security layer that integrates with DDS by using Kerberos tickets to identify and authenticate valid DDS nodes. This thesis evaluates DDS-C performance, determining if authentication overhead impedes DDS operations by using Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) and Cyclone DDS as testbeds. Additionally, DDS-C is integrated into a commercial network artificial intelligence (AI) provided by Bright Apps as a real-world use case. The results of this research conclude that DDS-C does not impact DDS operations to any significant degree. The added security and minimal middleware impact could help the military ensure node integrity in operational missions.},

In contrast to other middlewares, µRT does not rely on specific transports for communication but can be used with any technology.

Often, function chains deﬁne a safety-critical automated control task with weakly-hard real-time constraints.

We therefore propose an approach that combines measurement, suitable distribution of deadlines, and application-level online monitoring that serves to supervise the execution of service-oriented software systems with multiple function chains and weakly-hard real-time constraints.

In particular, TSN specifies a time-triggered scheduling mechanism in IEEE Std 802.1Qbv implemented by switches to control when outgoing queues get access to switch ports. Besides this time-triggered scheduling mechanism, other scheduling mechanisms can be active in the network at the same time including priority queuing and a credit-based shaper. Moreover, further supporting mechanisms such as the possibility to interrupt frames already in transmission (frame preemption) are specified by the TSN standards. Overall, this leads to a complex network infrastructure transporting both, real-time and non-real-time traffic in one converged network, making it hard to analyze the behavior of converged networks. To facilitate the analysis of TSN networks, we present TSN-specific extensions to the popular OMNeT++/INET framework for network simulations in this paper including, in particular, the time-triggered scheduling mechanism of IEEE Std 802.1Qbv.

To extend TSN to “IEEE 802.11” wireless networks, two challenging problems must be solved: synchronization and scheduling. This article is focused on the first one. Even though a few solutions already meet the required synchronization accuracies, they are built on expensive hardware that is not suited for mass market products. While next Wi-Fi generation might support the required functionalities, this article proposes a novel method that makes high-precision wireless synchronization using commercial low-cost components possible. With the proposed solution, a standard deviation of synchronization error of less than 500 ns can be achieved for many use cases and system loads on both CPU and network. This performance is comparable to modern wired real-time field buses, which makes the developed method a significant contribution for the extension of the TSN protocol to the wireless domain.},

	doi = {10.1109/DASC.2018.8569454},
	abstract = {Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTEthernet) is a time-critical network for industrial and avionics applications improved from the Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX). It is standardized by SAE AS6802 and satisfies strict timing transmission by use of a mixture infrastructure to support Time-Triggered (TT), Rate-Constraint (RC) and Best-Effort (BE) traffics. The key feature is a time-triggered communication paradigm according to off-line schedule table based on global synchronization. Three integration methods (preemption, timely block and shuffling) are used to resolve conflict when a TT message gets ready and a RC message is already in transmission. Besides several real-time Ethernet solutions, Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) shows great interests and attractions to satisfy the increasing and variable transmission requirements for automotive and aeronautical industry. TSN is comprised of several IEEE standards developed under IEEE 802.1 TSN Task Group, such as 802.1AS, 802.1Qav, 802.1Qat, 802.1BA, 802.1Qbv and 802.1Qbu. On top of SPQ (Static Priority Queuing) scheduling mechanism, with best effort traffics in parallel, TSN introduces guaranteed timing behavior with focus on the transportation for Control Data traffic (CDT) under Time Aware Shaper (TAS) and audio video streams under Credit-Based Shaper (CBS). This paper introduces the basic principles of TSN standard in details, compares it with the properties of the TTEthernet standard. In particular, we first investigate their clock synchronization algorithms and discuss their shaping and scheduling strategies for traffic types with individual timing requirements. Then we show the impact the hard real-time traffic has on soft real-time traffic and give the worst case end-to-end latency calculation. Finally, we determine whether TSN offers flexibility for the requirements of avionic.},

This paper provides an up-to-date comprehensive survey of the IEEE TSN and IETF DetNet standards and the related research studies. The survey of these standards and research studies is organized according to the main categories of flow concept, flow synchronization, flow management, flow control, and flow integrity. ULL networking mechanisms play a critical role in the emerging fifth generation (5G) network access chain from wireless devices via access, backhaul, and core networks. We survey the studies that specifically target the support of ULL in 5G networks, with the main categories of fronthaul, backhaul, and network management. Throughout, we identify the pitfalls and limitations of the existing standards and research studies. This survey can thus serve as a basis for the development of standards enhancements and future ULL research studies that address the identified pitfalls and limitations.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of a Multi-level Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) protocol based on a real-time communication platform utilizing Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware for data transfer of synchronous three phase measurement data. To transfer ultra-high three phase measurement samples, the DDS open-source protocol is exploited to shape the network's data traffic according to specific Quality of Service (QoS) profiles, leading to low packet loss and low latency by synchronizing and prioritizing the data in the network. Meanwhile the TSN protocol enables time-synchronization of the measured data by providing a common time reference to all the measurement devices in the network, making the system less expensive, more secure and enabling time-synchronization where acquiring GPS signals is a challenge. A software library was developed and used as a central Quality of Service (QoS) profile for the TSN implementation. The proposed design and implemented real-time simulation prototype presented in this paper takes in consideration diverse scenarios at multiple levels of prioritization including publishers, subscribers, and data packets. This allows granular control and monitoring of the data for traffic shaping, scheduling, and prioritization. The major strength of this protocol lies in the fact that it's not only in real time but it's time-critical too. The simulation prototype implementation was performed using the Real Time Innovation (RTI) Connext connectivity framework, custom-built MATLAB classes and DDS Simulink blocks. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol achieves low latency and high throughput, which makes it a desired option for various communication systems involved in microgrids, smart cities, military applications and potentially other time-critical applications, where GPS signals become vulnerable and data transfer needs to be prioritized.},

In a recent effort to meet these requirements, the IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has developed a set of standards that introduce novel features in Switched Ethernet. TSN standards offer, for example, a common notion of time through accurate and reliable clock synchronization, delay bounds for real-time traffic, time-driven transmissions, improved reliability, and much more. In order to fully utilize the potential of these novel protocols in the automotive domain, TSN should be seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art and state-of-practice model-based development processes for automotive embedded systems. Some of the core phases in these processes include software architecture modeling, timing predictability verification, simulation, and hardware realization and deployment. Moreover, throughout the development of automotive embedded systems, the safety and security requirements specified on these systems need to be duly taken into account. In this context, this work provides an overview of TSN in automotive applications and discusses the recent technological developments relevant to the adoption of TSN in automotive embedded systems.

We present a formulation in the integer linear programming (ILP) framework which models the joint routing and scheduling problem for flows of periodic real-time transmissions in converged TSN networks. In the joint routing and scheduling problem, both routes and schedules for real-time transmissions are computed in one step, i.e. we do not schedule over predefined routes. We explore the practical limitations of this approach by evaluating the runtime of problem instances with widely varying parameters with a state-of-the-art ILP solver. The observed solver runtimes indicate the qualitative impact of the number of real-time flows, the size of the network, the transmission frequency of real-time transmissions, and the network topology.},

When such a system is composed of multiple subsystems, or nodes, each of which is a geographically separate system, such a system of systems is called a distributed real-time system. The computation at each node must adhere to the timing requirements, and the connecting communication channels must never cause delays that trigger further timing violations. In this paper, we introduce Deterministic Network Channels, a network construct using Time Sensitive Networking QoS mechanisms that add reliable and deterministic communication for distributed tasks. Introducing such network channels as a construct allows designers to focus on higher-level primitives when building distributed systems. We describe our reference implementation and evaluate it by extending Timed C with network channels. Building on this, we also perform a thorough performance evaluation to determine practical bounds for both Linux and TSN under heavy workloads and adverse network conditions to show how the proposed reference implementation performs in real-world scenarios. In our tests, we can synchronize two separate machines running commercial off-the-shelf hardware to within 15μs of each other under severe internal and external interference.},

The coordination mechanism between the components in these frameworks, however, gives rise to nondeterminism, where factors such as communication timing can lead to arbitrary ordering in the handling of messages. In this paper, we demonstrate the significance of this problem in an open-source full-stack autonomous driving software, Autoware.Auto 1.0, which relies on ROS 2. We give an alternative: Xronos, an open-source framework for distributed embedded systems that has a novel coordination strategy with predictable properties under clearly stated assumptions. If these assumptions are violated, Xronos provides for application-specific fault handlers to be invoked. We port Autoware.Auto to Xronos and show that it avoids the identified problems with manageable cost in end-to-end latency. Furthermore, we compare the maximum throughput of Xronos to ROS 2 and MQTT using microbenchmarks under different settings, including on three different hardware configurations, and find that it can match or exceed those frameworks in terms of throughput.},

	abstract = {Cloud-based robotics systems leverage a wide range of Information Technologies (IT) to offer tangible benefits like cost reduction, powerful computational capabilities, data offloading, etc. However, the centralized nature of cloud computing is not well-suited for a multitude of Operational Technologies (OT) nowadays used in robotics systems that require strict real-time guarantees and security. Edge computing and fog computing are complementary approaches that aim at mitigating some of these challenges by providing computing capabilities closer to the users. The goal of this work is hence threefold: i) to analyze the current edge computing and fog computing landscape in the context of robotics systems, ii) to experimentally evaluate an end-to-end robotics system based on solutions proposed in the literature, and iii) to experimentally identify current benefits and open challenges of edge computing and fog computing. Results show that, in the case of an exemplary delivery application comprising two mobile robots, the robot coordination and range can be improved by consuming real-time radio information available at the edge. However, our evaluation highlights that the existing software, wireless and virtualization technologies still require substantial evolution to fully support edge-based robotics systems.},

	abstract = {The classical design of industrial robot controllers relies strongly on constant and stable cycle times for any closed loop operation. Meanwhile, decentralizing robot control into independent services and rolling them out to virtual machines and cloud instances is an upcoming trend. The advantage of the distributed robot control lies in achieving full flexibility of location independent service execution. In contrast, the internet connectivity leads to unknown latency conditions and resulting unpredictable cycle times. That is not well handled by standard feedback controllers like PID or P-PI cascades. In addition to the time-critical aspect, the performance of a closed -loop control relies on the accuracy of the underlying model. Modeling is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents four different implementations of a non-model based modified Switching Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) in a robotic use case. The comparison of these four concepts reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the ADRC approach regarding controller performance under the assumption of full dynamics compensation with tough communication conditions. By extending the Switching-ADRC approach by a gain-scheduler to smooth the switching between the linear and non-linear ADRC description and a static adjustment of control-parameters related to the measured round-trip time, the presented control-concept is able to stabilize the high-dynamic, partly unstable robot-system without model-information. The stability of the modified Switching-ADRC is demonstrated empirically by extensive experiments with a distributed industrial robot joint position control.},

	url = {https://open.uct.ac.za/handle/11427/35755},
	abstract = {In production industries, mission-critical assignments require networks characterised by deterministic low latency, dedicated bandwidth resources, and, chiefly, reliability. Several fieldbus technologies are specially placed for this. Their commonality is that they run on standard Ethernet. The relatively new Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is among these technologies. It is a set of Ethernet standards that guarantees determinism for real-time usecases. TSN sets itself apart in that it is vendor-agnostic. And so, it promotes interoperability among standard-conformant devices. Being based on Ethernet, even TSN is plagued by downsides associated with cabled networks, most importantly, the limited range and mobility. In this regard, wireless networks are an attractive option – it would be an opportunistic venture to operate TSN in the wireless medium. Previous works have tried to address how this can be done, but as yet, it is an open problem. The issue is that most wireless networks are not optimised for determinism. Most lack the scheduling, synchronisation and other capabilities that timing-stringent applications require. Wi-Fi, for instance, suffers from many issues stemming from randomised medium access and interference, which remove the predictability from its communications. Critical TSN traffic needs special consideration when run with other services in current Wi-Fi. That being said, the key research question is: can one contend with the problem of transmitting TSN and non-TSN traffic together in the same wireless network? To answer this, the work develops a TSN simulation model that operates in Wi-Fi, whose test results can be studied to aid in analysing wireless TSN. The prototype model runs in a simulation environment, and was developed using methods that involved reusing and modifying the present wireless architecture to support the TSN traffic. Through the course of several iterative experiments, it was revealed that although the current generation of Wi-Fi can support TSN traffic, it does so inefficiently. Even with no interference, the TSN traffic experiences low losses only when the network capacity utilisation is very low, below a small percentage value. Considering the typically low demands on bandwidth in many TSN applications, this inefficient operation may still be sufficient for operating TSN over existing Wi-Fi networks. For more robust and general applications, Wi-Fi requires further enhancements to its mode of operation in order to support prioritisation of TSN traffic and more accurately cope with higher loads.},

	abstract = {The IEEE Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group has recently standardized enhancements for IEEE 802.3 networks for enabling it to transport time-triggered traffic (aka scheduled traffic) providing them with stringent bounds on network delay and jitter while also transporting best-effort traffic. These enhancements primarily include dedicating one queue per port of the switch for scheduled traffic along with a programmable gating mechanism that dictates which of the queues are to be considered for transmission. While the IEEE 802.1Qbv standards define these mechanisms to handle scheduled traffic, it stops short of specifying algorithms to compute fine-grained link schedules for the streams of scheduled traffic. Further, the mechanisms in TSN require creation of so-called guard bands to isolate scheduled traffic from the best-effort traffic. These guard bands may potentially result in bandwidth wastage, and hence schedules with lower number of guard bands are preferred. In this paper, we introduce the No-wait Packet Scheduling Problem (NW-PSP) for modelling the scheduling in IEEE Time-sensitive Networks and map it to the No-wait Job-shop Scheduling Problem (NW-JSP), a well-known problem from the field of operational research. In particular, we present a Tabu search algorithm for efficient computing of schedules and a schedule compression technique to reduce number of guard bands in schedule. Our evaluations show that our Tabu search algorithm can compute near-optimal schedules for over 1500 flows and the subsequent schedule compression reduces the number of guard bands on an average by 24\%.},

Broadband communication networks within vehicles have become necessary. New autonomous Ethernet networks are being considered as alternatives. The Ethernet-based in-vehicle network has been standardized in the IEEE 802.1 time-sensitive network (TSN) group since 2006. The Ethernet TSN will be revised and integrated into a subsequent version of IEEE 802.1Q-2018 published in 2018 when various new TSN-related standards are being newly revised and published. A TSN integrated environment simulator is developed in this paper to implement the main functions of the TSN standards that are being developed. This effort would minimize the performance gaps that can occur when the functions of these standards operate in an integrated environment. As part of this purpose, we analyzed the simulator to verify that the traffic for autonomous driving satisfies the TSN transmission requirements in the in-vehicle network (IVN) and the preemption (which is one of the main TSN functions) and reduces the overall End-to-End delay. An optimal guard band size for the preemption was also found for autonomous vehicles in our work. Finally, an IVN model for autonomous vehicles was designed and the performance test was conducted by configuring the traffic to be used for various sensors and electronic control units (ECUs).},

TSN provides guaranteed data transport with bounded low latency, low delay variation, and extremely low data loss for time and/or mission critical traffic. By reserving resources for critical traffic, and applying various queuing and shaping techniques, TSN achieves zero congestion loss for critical data traffic. This, in turn, allows TSN to guarantee a worst-case end-to-end latency for critical data. TSN also provides ultra-reliability for data traffic via a data packet level reliability mechanism as well as protection against bandwidth violation, malfunctioning, malicious attacks, etc. TSN includes reliable time synchronization, a profile of IEEE 1588, which provides the basis for many other TSN functions.},

	abstract = {Future autonomous vehicles and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) need real-time audio and video transmission together with control data traffic (CDT). Audio/video stream delay analysis has been largely investigated in AVB (Audio Video Bridging) context, but not yet with the presence of the CDT in the new TSN context. In this paper we present a local delay analysis of AVB frames under hierarchical scheduling of credit-based shaping and time-aware shaping on TSN switches. We present the effects of time aware shaping on AVB traffic, how it changes the relative order of transmission of frames leading to bursts and worst case scenarios for lower priority streams. We also show that these bursts are upper-bounded by the Credit-Bases Shaper, hence the worst-case transmissions delay of a given stream is also upper-bounded. We present the analysis to compute the worst case delay for a frame, as well as the feasibility condition necessary for the analysis to be applied. Our methods (analysis and simulation) are applied to an automotive use case, which is defined within the Eurostars RETINA project, and where both control data traffic and AVB traffic must be guaranteed.},

In research institutions the ﬁrst version of the Robot Operating System (ROS1) is widely used for different applications. However, ROS1 lacks real-time capable communication. The ongoing development of ROS2 promises to break this paradigm. By employing Data Distribution Service (DDS) as a middleware the modular architecture aims at providing realtime capabilities. This study assesses the current prospects and limitations of ROS2. It gains novel insights towards improved and, in particular, reliable results regarding latencies and jitter. To this end, the allocation and transmission of ROS2 messages is evaluated in an example application for robotic control. An oscilloscope is applied for external validation of the measurements in such a time-synchronized distributed network. The complete application is set up from non-real-time object detection towards real-time control via ROS2 and EtherCAT. An in-depth evaluation of the ROS2 communication stack on a single host and in distributed setups is included. With real-time safe memory allocation and highly privileged ROS2 processes real-time capabilities are ensured.},

	abstract = {Multi-agent robot systems, specifically mobile robots in dynamic environments interacting with humans, e.g., assisting in production environments, have seen an increased interest over the past years. To better understand the ROS2 communication in a network with a high load of nodes, this paper investigates the communication handling of multiple robots to a single tracking node for centralized multi-agent robot systems using ROS2. Thereore, a quantitative analysis of two publisher-subscriber communication architectures and a comparative study between DDS vendors (CycloneDDS, FastDDS and GurumDDS) using ROS2 Galactic is performed. The architectures of consideration are a many-to-one approach, where multiple robots communicate to a central node over one topic, and the one-to-one communication approach, where multiple robots communicate over particular topics to a central node. Throughout this work, the increase in the number of robots at different publishing rates is simulated on a single computer for the different DDS vendors. A further simulation is done using a distributed setup with CycloneDDS. The simulations show that with an increase in the number of nodes, the average data age and the data miss ratio in the one-to-one approach were significantly lower than in the many-to-one approach. CycloneDDS was shown as the most robust regarding crashes and response time under system launch, while FastDDS showed better results regarding the data ageing.},

	abstract = {Robot Operating System (ROS) is a de-facto standard robot middleware in many academic and industrial use cases. However, utilizing ROS/ROS2 in safety-critical embedded applications with real-time requirement is challenging because of C1) Non-real-time underlying hardware, C2) No control on the host OS scheduler, C3) Unpredictable dynamic memory allocation, C4) High resource requirement, and C5) Unpredictable execution model for ROS nodes. In this paper, we address these limiting factors by proposing a hardwaresoftware architecture -CompROS- for ROS2 based robotic development in a Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) platform. The proposed hardware architecture consists of a Hard Real-Time (HRT) RISC-V based subsystem implemented in the Programmable Logic (PL) part of the MPSoC platform, a Soft Real-Time (SRT) ARM-based subsystem in the Processing System (PS) part of the MPSoC platform, and a Non-Real-Time (NRT) PC. While the proposed hardware architecture along with a partitioning layer overcomes the first two limiting factors, the rest are managed by the proposed multi-layer software architecture. We make a bare-metal implementation of XRCE-DDS standard for PL-PS communication, while peer-to-peer PL-PL communication is done through a proposed real-time publish-subscribe approach. The reliable communication for PS-PL communication is done through utilizing C-HEAP protocol. Further, we integrate ROS2 software layers on top of the proposed hardware and software layers. Finally, with respect to C5, we present a real-time execution model of ROS2 nodes by a mapping of ROS2 entities to CompROS entities, which is validated through experimental results. We run ROS2 middleware with an executable size of less than 200 KB on an MPSoC platform.},

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 is the German vision for the future of manufacturing, where smart factories use information and communication technologies to digitise their processes to achieve improved quality, lower costs, and increased efficiency. It is likely to bring a massive change to the way control systems function today. Future distributed control systems are expected to have an increased connectivity to the Internet, in order to capitalize on new offers and research findings related to digitalization, such as cloud, big data, and machine learning. A key technology in the realization of distributed control systems is middleware, which is usually described as a reusable software layer between operating system and distributed applications. Various middleware technologies have been proposed to facilitate communication in industrial control systems and hide the heterogeneity amongst the subsystems, such as OPC UA, DDS, and RT-CORBA. These technologies can significantly simplify the system design and integration of devices despite their heterogeneity. However, each of these technologies has its own characteristics that may work better for particular applications. Selection of the best middleware for a specific application is a critical issue for system designers. In this paper, we conduct a survey on available standard middleware technologies, including OPC UA, DDS, and RT-CORBA, and show new trends for different industrial domains.},

	abstract = {Designing Distributed Control Systems presents 80 patterns for designing distributed machine control system software architecture (forestry machinery, mining drills, elevators, etc.). These patterns originate from state-of-the-art systems from market-leading companies, have been tried and tested, and will address typical challenges in the domain, such as long lifecycle, distribution, real-time and fault tolerance. Each pattern describes a separate design problem that needs to be solved. Solutions are provided, with consequences and trade-offs. Each solution will enable piecemeal growth of the design. Finding a solution is easy, as the patterns are divided into categories based on the problem field the pattern tackles. The design process is guided by different aspects of quality, such as performance and extendibility, which are included in the pattern descriptions. The book also contains an example software architecture designed by leading industry experts using the patterns in the book. The example system introduces the reader to the problem domain and demonstrates how the patterns can be used in a practical system design process. The example architecture shows how useful a toolbox the patterns provide for both novices and experts, guiding the system design process from its beginning to the finest details. Designing distributed machine control systems with patterns ensures high quality in the final product. High-quality systems will improve revenue and guarantee customer satisfaction. As market need changes, the desire to produce a quality machine is not only a primary concern, there is also a need for easy maintenance, to improve efficiency and productivity, as well as the growing importance of environmental values; these all impact machine design. The software of work machines needs to be designed with these new requirements in mind. Designing Distributed Control Systems presents patterns to help tackle these challenges. With proven methodologies from the expert author team, they show readers how to improve the quality and efficiency of distributed control systems.},

To address this problem, this paper proposes a framework for construction of an industrial automation system. The system consists of 2 parts, which are motion control system (MCS) and OpenPLC. The MCS is based on ROS2, which provides real-time communication middleware. Furthermore, this paper implements new function blocks to connect OpenPLC and the MCS. With this system, it only needs OpenPLC language to realize the control rather than using different languages to control robots and other equipment in an automation line. In section 4, a simple use case is put forward. The experiment validated the correctness and feasibility of this framework.},

Each vehicle has a nonlinear model predictive tracking controller, which keeps it as close as possible to the path demanded by the task, and coordinates and avoids collisions with nearby vehicles. To do this, it receives the motion trajectories of all other vehicles in its vicinity that may interfere with its own projected motion via a wireless network, and incorporates these trajectories in the computation of its own optimal control action. Each controller is supervised by a higher-level task controller that determines a limited set of the controller's parameters. Simulation experiments have shown that the minimisation of the tracking error along a finite horizon enabled the controller to track paths containing sharp turns, by applying appropriate steering well in advance of the turn. It has also been shown that the variation of specific predictive controller parameters results in a wide range of behaviours; i.e., vehicles can move in both operating modes, coordinate with nearby vehicles by altering their velocity profiles or the shapes of their paths, and avoid collisions.},

This result is obtained by driving the robots along the negative gradient of an appropriately defined function of the algebraic connectivity. The proposed strategy is then enhanced with the introduction of the concept of critical robots, that is robots for which the loss of a single communication link might cause the disconnection of the communication graph. Limiting the control action to critical robots will be shown to reduce the control effort that is introduced by the proposed connectivity maintenance control law and to mitigate its effect on the additional (desired) control term.},

Those topics have several overlapping research communities; for that reason they are characterized by different definitions and a variety of approaches ranging from rigorous mathematical analysis to trial-and-error experimental study or emulation by observation of natural phenomena. The areas involved concern robotics, dynamic systems, computer science, signal theory, biology, economics, and mathematics. A shared taxonomy is missing; for example, dynamic systems can be identified in robots, agents, nodes, processors, and entities. An ensemble is called a group, network, platoon, swarm, team, and cluster, and the algorithms are defined as controllers, protocols, and dynamics. In the following, the term agent is used to denote the single dynamic system and network or collective the ensemble.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates a synchronization approach to trajectory tracking of networked robotic systems while maintaining time-varying formations. The objective is to control networked robots to track a desired trajectory while synchronizing their behaviors. Combining trajectory tracking and synchronization algorithms, the developed approach uses a cross-coupling technical to create interconnections for mutual synchronization of robots. The main objective of distributed approach is to generate an emerging behavior using only local information interactions. First, a distributed scheme is developed to achieve the networked robots synchronization on undirected graph. Then, the leaderless synchronized tracking problem in the case when only position measurements are available, will be presented. For both cases: In the presence of the velocity feedback or in its absence, the controller, designed by incorporating the cross-coupling technical into a sliding mode control architecture, successfully guarantees asymptotic convergence to zero of both position tracking and synchronization errors simultaneously. The Lyapunov-based approach has been used to establish the multi-robot systems asymptotic stability. A real-time software simulator is developed to visualize the synchronized behaviors. Based on LabVIEW integrated development environment (IDE), a developed human-machine-interface (HMI) allows its user to control, in real time, the networked robots. Simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate performances of the proposed control schemes.},

	abstract = {NASA mission concepts for the upcoming decades of this century include exploration of sites such as steep cliff faces on Mars, as well as infrastructure deployment for a sustained robotic/manned presence on planetary and/or the lunar surface. Single robotic platforms, such as the Sojourner rover successfully flown in 1997 and the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) which landed on Mars in January of 2004, have neither the autonomy, mobility, nor manipulation capabilities for such ambitious undertakings. One possible approach to these future missions is the fielding of cooperative multi-robot systems that have the required onboard control algorithms to more or less autonomously perform tightly coordinated tasks. These control algorithms must operate under the constrained mass, volume, processing, and communication conditions that are present on NASA planetary surface rover systems. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of distributed control algorithms that build on our earlier development of an enabling architecture called CAMPOUT (Control Architecture for Multi-robot Planetary Outposts). We also report on some ongoing physical experiments in tightly coupled distributed control at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, CA where in the first study two rovers acquire and carry an extended payload over uneven, natural terrain, and in the second three rovers form a team for cliff access.},

This motivates the need for an interprocess communication (IPC) facility which would integrate the individual elements both within and between workcells. A survey of IPC is presented in the context of distributed robotics. To make the survey more meaningful, it is introduced by some remarks about general approaches to communication within a distributed computing environment.

In the paper, an on-line trajectory generator is described in which the history of motion is planned and executed in real time. The computational complexities of the minimum-time requirements of the motion have been reduced significantly by distributing the proposed algorithm on a multiprocessor system. The practical implementation of the distributed system on a T800 transputer network shows its efficiency in accomplishing the required task.

This paper provides a review of multi-robot systems supporting SAR operations, with system-level considerations and focusing on the algorithmic perspectives for multi-robot coordination and perception. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first survey paper to cover (i) heterogeneous SAR robots in different environments, (ii) active perception in multi-robot systems, while (iii) giving two complementary points of view from the multi-agent perception and control perspectives. We also discuss the most significant open research questions: shared autonomy, sim-to-real transferability of existing methods, awareness of victims' conditions, coordination and interoperability in heterogeneous multi-robot systems, and active perception. The different topics in the survey are put in the context of the different challenges and constraints that various types of robots (ground, aerial, surface, or underwater) encounter in different SAR environments (maritime, urban, wilderness, or other post-disaster scenarios). The objective of this survey is to serve as an entry point to the various aspects of multi-robot SAR systems to researchers in both the machine learning and control fields by giving a global overview of the main approaches being taken in the SAR robotics area.},

	abstract = {Multicore processors are gaining popularity in various domains because of their potential for maximizing system throughput of average-case tasks. In real-time systems, where processes and tasks are governed by stringent temporal constraints, the worst-case timings should be considered, and migration to multicore processors leads to additional difficulties. Resource sharing between the cores introduces timing overheads, which affect the worst-case timings and schedulability of the entire system. In this article, we provide new insights into the performance of the real-time extensions of Linux, namely, Xenomai and RT-Preempt, for a homogeneous multicore processor. First, complete details on leveraging both real-time extensions are presented. We identify various multicore deployments and discuss their trade-offs, as established through the experimental evaluation of the scheduling latency. Then, we propose a statistical method based on a variation of chi-square test to determine the best multicore deployment. The unexpected effects of interfering loads, such as CPU, memory, and network operations, on the real-time performance, are considered. Feasibility of the best multicore deployment is verified through the analysis of its periodicity and deterministic response times in a pre-emptive multitasking environment. This research is the first of its kind and will serve as a useful guideline for developing real-time applications on multicore processors.},

With autonomous systems performing tasks whose criticality increases by the day (i.e., autonomous robots, vehicles, drones), it becomes necessary for robotics tools to allow room for real-time wrappers, toolboxes and built-in methods for accurate timing analysis. ROS (Robot Operating System) is becoming the standard in robotics programming, providing standardized core of functions. However, it was initially not written having real-time systems requirements in mind. ROS2 proposes built-in real-time capabilities for safety-critical systems.

	abstract = {Correct real-time software is vital for robots in safety-critical roles such as service and disaster response. These systems depend on software for locomotion, navigation, manipulation, and even seemingly innocuous tasks such as safely regulating battery voltage. A multiprocess software design increases robustness by isolating errors to a single process, allowing the rest of the system to continue operation. This approach also assists with modularity and concurrency. For real-time tasks, such as dynamic balance and force control of manipulators, it is critical to communicate the latest data sample with minimum latency. There are many communication approaches intended for both general-purpose and real-time needs [9], [13], [15], [17], [19]. Typical methods focus on reliable communication or network transparency and accept a tradeoff of increased message latency or the potential to discard newer data. By focusing instead on the specific case of real-time communication on a single host, we reduce communication latency and guarantee access to the latest sample. We present a new interprocess communication (IPC) library, Ach which addresses this need, and discuss its application for real-time multiprocess control on three humanoid robots (Figure 1). (Ach is available at http://www.golems.org/projects/ach.html. The name Ach comes from the common abbreviation for the motor neurotransmitter Acetylcholine and the computer networking term ACK.)},

A network-based model for the unmanned marine vehicle in the network environments is established for the first time by taking sampler-to-control station packet dropouts, network-induced delays, and packet disordering into account. This model is then extended to the unmanned marine vehicle system in the network environments subject to control station-to-actuator, and both sampler-to-control station and control station-to-actuator packet dropouts, network-induced delays, and packet disordering. Based on these models, dynamic output feedback controllers are designed to attenuate the oscillation amplitudes of the yaw velocity error and the yaw angle. It is shown through a benchmark example that (i) compared with the unmanned marine vehicle without control, the designed dynamic output feedback controllers can attenuate the oscillation amplitudes of the yaw velocity error and the yaw angle; and (ii) the designed dynamic output feedback controllers can provide much smaller oscillation amplitudes of the yaw velocity error and the yaw angle than a proportional–integral controller.},
