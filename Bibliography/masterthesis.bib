	abstract = {Modern robots are mainly controlled by monolithic black-box controllers provided by the individual manufacturers. In research institutions the first version of the Robot Operating System ({ROS}1) is widely used for different applications. However, {ROS}1 lacks real-time capable communication. The ongoing development of {ROS}2 promises to break this paradigm. By employing Data Distribution Service ({DDS}) as a middleware the modular architecture aims at providing realtime capabilities. This study assesses the current prospects and limitations of {ROS}2. It gains novel insights towards improved and, in particular, reliable results regarding latencies and jitter. To this end, the allocation and transmission of {ROS}2 messages is evaluated in an example application for robotic control. An oscilloscope is applied for external validation of the measurements in such a time-synchronized distributed network. The complete application is set up from non-real-time object detection towards real-time control via {ROS}2 and {EtherCAT}. An in-depth evaluation of the {ROS}2 communication stack on a single host and in distributed setups is included. With real-time safe memory allocation and highly privileged {ROS}2 processes real-time capabilities are ensured.},

The Robot Operating System ({ROS}), open-source middleware, has been widely used for robotics applications. However, the {ROS} is not suitable for real-time embedded systems because it does not satisfy real-time requirements and only runs on a few {OSs}. To address this problem, {ROS}1 will undergo a significant upgrade to {ROS}2 by utilizing the Data Distribution Service ({DDS}). {DDS} is suitable for real-time distributed embedded systems due to its various transport configurations (e.g., deadline and fault-tolerance) and scalability. {ROS}2 must convert data for {DDS} and abstract {DDS} from its users; however, this incurs additional overhead, which is examined in this study. Transport latencies between {ROS}2 nodes vary depending on the use cases, data size, configurations, and {DDS} vendors. We conduct proof of concept for {DDS} approach to {ROS} and arrange {DDS} characteristic and guidelines from various evaluations. By highlighting the {DDS} capabilities, we explore and evaluate the potential and constraints of {DDS} and {ROS}2.},

	shorttitle = {{CompROS}},
	abstract = {Robot Operating System ({ROS}) is a de-facto standard robot middleware in many academic and industrial use cases. However, utilizing {ROS}/{ROS}2 in safety-critical embedded applications with real-time requirement is challenging because of C1) Non-real-time underlying hardware, C2) No control on the host {OS} scheduler, C3) Unpredictable dynamic memory allocation, C4) High resource requirement, and C5) Unpredictable execution model for {ROS} nodes. In this paper, we address these limiting factors by proposing a hardwaresoftware architecture -{CompROS}- for {ROS}2 based robotic development in a Multi-Processor System on Chip ({MPSoC}) platform. The proposed hardware architecture consists of a Hard Real-Time ({HRT}) {RISC}-V based subsystem implemented in the Programmable Logic ({PL}) part of the {MPSoC} platform, a Soft Real-Time ({SRT}) {ARM}-based subsystem in the Processing System ({PS}) part of the {MPSoC} platform, and a Non-Real-Time ({NRT}) {PC}. While the proposed hardware architecture along with a partitioning layer overcomes the first two limiting factors, the rest are managed by the proposed multi-layer software architecture. We make a bare-metal implementation of {XRCE}-{DDS} standard for {PL}-{PS} communication, while peer-to-peer {PL}-{PL} communication is done through a proposed real-time publish-subscribe approach. The reliable communication for {PS}-{PL} communication is done through utilizing C-{HEAP} protocol. Further, we integrate {ROS}2 software layers on top of the proposed hardware and software layers. Finally, with respect to C5, we present a real-time execution model of {ROS}2 nodes by a mapping of {ROS}2 entities to {CompROS} entities, which is validated through experimental results. We run {ROS}2 middleware with an executable size of less than 200 {KB} on an {MPSoC} platform.},

Properties such as security, liveness and priority of {DDS} in {ROS}2 were verified. The results show that the design satisfies these properties and high-priority messages can be sent and transmitted preferentially by the system.

Robot systems architecture based on {ROS} and {ROS}2 have attracted more and more attention due to the flexibility, openness, modularity, scalability and friendliness. The main contribution of this article is to partially construct the real-time architecture of the collaborative robot control system. In addition, the timing jitter of the system, {EtherCAT} master station and {ROS} under different frequencies and loads is analyzed. First, a Linux kernel based on {PREEMPT}\_RT patch is constructed, the basic architecture is described, and the timing performance of the robot system is improved through the application of high-precision timers, priority assignment, scheduling mode, and energy consumption management. Furthermore, the timing jitter performance of the operating system is analyzed. The maximum jitter of the system and the {EtherCAT} master station is about 10 us, and the average jitter is 1 us. Finally, the timing jitter of the built-in timing callbacks in {ROS} and {ROS}2 is evaluated. The design of the real-time system and performance analysis provide critical support for the design of the robot controller.},

	abstract = {Wireless communications offer significant benefits over wired communications, which has increased their popularity in industrial applications. Nevertheless, the existing wireless standard technologies do not satisfy the requirements demanded by the most critical industrial applications and thus, wired communications cannot be directly replaced by wireless solutions. Moreover, the inclusion of movable nodes in the network brings new challenges, such as the handover mechanism. In this paper, a hybrid wired/wireless architecture designed for industrial control applications is proposed. To control the wired network, a time-sensitive network ({TSN}) is used and to control the wireless network a medium access control ({MAC}) protocol is designed. In order to communicate both networks, a bridge that acts as a deterministic access point ({AP}) with real-time features is also proposed. One of the fundamental parts of the proposed architecture is that it can be used in applications with mobility requirements. Hence, a soft-handover algorithm is designed which guarantees uninterrupted communication during its execution without the need for a second radio interface and with reduced growth in network overhead. The proposed architecture is evaluated in order to assess its performance. This paper extends our previous work, including both a theoretical analysis to determine the delay bounds of the proposed architecture and a comparison between the performances of the proposed handover algorithm with other algorithms proposed in the literature. The evaluation has been carried out through {OMNeT}++ simulations. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed handover algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art solutions.},

This paper presents a review of the state-of-the-art of distributed filtering and control of industrial {CPSs} described by differential dynamics models. Special attention is paid to sensor networks, manipulators, and power systems. For real-time monitoring, some typical Kalman-based distributed algorithms are summarized and their performances on calculation burden and communication burden, as well as scalability, are discussed in depth. Then, the characteristics of non-Kalman cases are further disclosed in light of constructed filter structures. Furthermore, the latest development is surveyed for distributed cooperative control of mobile manipulators and distributed model predictive control in industrial automation systems. By resorting to droop characteristics, representative distributed control strategies classified by controller structures are systematically summarized for power systems with the requirements of power sharing and voltage and frequency regulation. In addition, distributed security control of industrial {CPSs} is reviewed when cyber-attacks are taken into consideration. Finally, some challenges are raised to guide the future research.},

Autonomous Intersection Management ({AIM}) is an outstanding example of using an autonomous vehicle and wireless communication technology. The traffic performance of a single {AIM} system has been proved in many works however, traffic in the network of multiple {AIMs} is waiting for an implementation. Coordination of traffic between intersections in the network is an important step of managing the overall networked traffic throughput. The authors modeled the traffic network with the multi-agents concept and used the discrete consensus algorithm to coordinate between autonomous agents and implemented the rerouting algorithm in order to distribute the excessive traffics to neighbored intersections with the optimal condition. Our target is to have a balance traffic in each intersection and reaches the equilibrium where the stability has been not compromised. The results show that reaching consensus condition will bring the networked traffic to an equilibrium state where a peak traffic will not be happened. In addition, this method shows that when traffic in a network reached consensus, it will also converge to the Nash equilibrium in the finite time.},

	abstract = {The design of humanoid robots naturally requires the simultaneous control of a high number of joints. Moreover, the performance of the overall robot is strongly determined by the low-level control system as all high-level software e.g. for locomotion planning and control is built on top of it. In order to achieve high update rates and high bandwidth for the joint control, an advanced real-time control system architecture is required. However, outdated communication protocols with associated limits in the achievable update rates are still used in nowadays humanoid robots. Moreover, the performance of the low-level control systems is not analyzed in detail or the systems rely on specialized hardware, which lacks reliability and persistence. We present a reliable and high-performance control system architecture for humanoid robots based on the {ETHERCAT} technology. To the authors' knowledge this is the only system, which operates at control rates beyond 2 khz and input/output latencies below 1 ms. Our control architecture includes a learning-based feedforward control strategy to improve joint tracking performance. The improved joint control method and the communication system are evaluated on our humanoid robot {LOLA}. Our software framework is available online to allow other researchers to benefit from our experiences.},

In this paper, a distributed control strategy is proposed for microgrid synchronization operation. The proposed controller design utilizes pinning-based consensus algorithm to avoid system single point of failure. It is able to actively track the main grid frequency, provide a good coordination between frequency and phase regulation and ensure all distributed generations in the system proportionally share the load. Implementation of such distributed algorithm in practice is difficult because it requires mitigation of both distributed computing and power system engineering challenges. In this paper, a novel software platform called {RIAPS} platform is presented that helps implementing the proposed distributed synchronization strategy in practical hardware controllers. The performance of the controllers are validated using a real-time controller hardware-in-the-loop microgrid testbed.},

According to the existing metallurgical industry control architecture, this paper proposes a structure of a metallurgical industry {CCS}. By analyzing the internal characteristics of the system, the system delay is decomposed into cloud delay and network delay, and the {CCS} time-delay model is obtained. Based on the established metallurgical industry {CCS} time-delay model, we design the delay controller by using state feedback and pole configuration methods, and propose a detailed internal structure model of the system. Finally, the typical links are simulated according to common signals in the metallurgical industry. The results show that the designed delay controller significantly improves the control performance of the metallurgical {CCS}.},

The proposed control strategy exploits a communication network to achieve proportional current sharing using a consensus-like algorithm. Voltage regulation is achieved by constraining the system to a suitable manifold. Two robust control strategies of sliding mode type are developed to reach the desired manifold in a finite time. The proposed control scheme is formally analyzed, proving the achievement of proportional current sharing, while guaranteeing that the weighted average voltage of the microgrid is identical to the weighted average of the voltage references.},

The navigation framework implements a kinematic controller which considers kinematic constraints such as robot nonholonomic constraints and obstacles and outputs linear and angular velocity commands to be implemented by the joint level controller. Usually the joint level relies on velocity servos, which neglect the dynamics of the robot or {PID} controllers, which are difficult to tune, due to the nonlinear model and unknown parameters of the model. The proposed model reference adaptive controller accepts velocities references, as required by the navigation framework and outputs the wheel torques to impose the commanded velocities. A formal proof of stability including the robot dynamics, controller and adaptation law is provided. Although it is not proved, as it depends on persistence of excitation on the reference signal, experimental results shows that the estimated parameters converge to values close to the actual ones.},

Accordingly, the security of {ROS} 2 is highly reliant on the security of its {DDS} communication protocol. However, finding a balance between the performance and security is non-trivial task. Inappropriate security implementations may cause not only significant loss on performance of the system, but also security failures in the system. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the {DDS} security protocol as well as an overview on how to find the balance between performance and security. To accomplish this, we evaluate the latency and throughput of the communication protocols of {ROS} 2 in both wired and wireless networks, and measure the efficiency loss caused by the enabling of security protocols such as Virtual Private Network ({VPN}) and {DDS} security protocol in {ROS} 2 in both network setups. The result can be directly used by robotics developers to find the optimal and balanced settings of {ROS} 2 applications. Additionally, we analyzed the security specification of {DDS} using existing security standards and tested the implementation of the {DDS} protocol by performing static analysis. The results of this work can be used to enhance the security of {ROS} 2.},

	abstract = {Mobile communications have been undergoing a generational change every ten years or so. However, the time difference between the so-called “G's” is also decreasing. While fifth-generation (5G) systems are becoming a commercial reality, there is already significant interest in systems beyond 5G, which we refer to as the sixth generation (6G) of wireless systems. In contrast to the already published papers on the topic, we take a top-down approach to 6G. More precisely, we present a holistic discussion of 6G systems beginning with lifestyle and societal changes driving the need for next-generation networks. This is followed by a discussion into the technical requirements needed to enable 6G applications, based on which we dissect key challenges and possibilities for practically realizable system solutions across all layers of the Open Systems Interconnection stack (i.e., from applications to the physical layer). Since many of the 6G applications will need access to an order-of-magnitude more spectrum, utilization of frequencies between 100 {GHz} and 1 {THz} becomes of paramount importance. As such, the 6G ecosystem will feature a diverse range of frequency bands, ranging from below 6 {GHz} up to 1 {THz}. We comprehensively characterize the limitations that must be overcome to realize working systems in these bands and provide a unique perspective on the physical and higher layer challenges relating to the design of next-generation core networks, new modulation and coding methods, novel multiple-access techniques, antenna arrays, wave propagation, radio frequency transceiver design, and real-time signal processing. We rigorously discuss the fundamental changes required in the core networks of the future, such as the redesign or significant reduction of the transport architecture that serves as a major source of latency for time-sensitive applications. This is in sharp contrast to the present hierarchical network architectures that are not suitable to realize many of the anticipated 6G services. While evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of key candidate 6G technologies, we differentiate what may be practically achievable over the next decade, relative to what is possible in theory. Keeping this in mind, we present concrete research challenges for each of the discussed system aspects, providing inspiration for what follows.},

This allows control, monitoring, traffic scheduling, and prioritization. Some buses in a microgrid may have priority over others; and this can be prioritized at the data level too, where a part of the information is more critical than the others. The advantages of utilizing the {TSN} protocol on a microgrid with the approach proposed are: it is an alternative to {GPS} technology, three-phase data can be exchanged at much faster rate and data traffic in the network can be shaped with low packet loss, and low latency, in addition to providing interoperability through Data Distribution Services ({DDS}). These enhancements improve the communication reliability and enable distributed control, resulting in avoidance of any bottlenecks in the communications network.

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of a Multi-level Time Sensitive Networking ({TSN}) protocol based on a real-time communication platform utilizing Data Distribution Service ({DDS}) middleware for data transfer of synchronous three phase measurement data. To transfer ultra-high three phase measurement samples, the {DDS} open-source protocol is exploited to shape the network's data traffic according to specific Quality of Service ({QoS}) profiles, leading to low packet loss and low latency by synchronizing and prioritizing the data in the network. Meanwhile the {TSN} protocol enables time-synchronization of the measured data by providing a common time reference to all the measurement devices in the network, making the system less expensive, more secure and enabling time-synchronization where acquiring {GPS} signals is a challenge. A software library was developed and used as a central Quality of Service ({QoS}) profile for the {TSN} implementation. The proposed design and implemented real-time simulation prototype presented in this paper takes in consideration diverse scenarios at multiple levels of prioritization including publishers, subscribers, and data packets. This allows granular control and monitoring of the data for traffic shaping, scheduling, and prioritization. The major strength of this protocol lies in the fact that it's not only in real time but it's time-critical too. The simulation prototype implementation was performed using the Real Time Innovation ({RTI}) Connext connectivity framework, custom-built {MATLAB} classes and {DDS} Simulink blocks. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol achieves low latency and high throughput, which makes it a desired option for various communication systems involved in microgrids, smart cities, military applications and potentially other time-critical applications, where {GPS} signals become vulnerable and data transfer needs to be prioritized.},

	abstract = {The transportation industry is facing major challenges that come along with innovative trends like autonomous driving. Due to the growing amount of network participants, smart sensors, and mixed-critical data, scalability and interoperability have become key factors of cost-efficient vehicle engineering. One solution to overcome these challenges is the {AUTOSAR} Adaptive software platform. Its service-oriented communication methodology allows a standardized data exchange that is not bound to a specific middleware protocol. {OPC} {UA} is a communication standard that is well-established in modern industrial automation. In addition to its Client–Server communication pattern, the newly released Publish–Subscribe ({PubSub}) architecture promotes scalability. {PubSub} is designed to work in conjunction with Time-Sensitive Networking ({TSN}), a collection of standards that add real-time aspects to standard Ethernet networks. {TSN} allows services with different requirements to share a single physical network. In this paper, we specify an integration approach of {AUTOSAR} Adaptive, {OPC} {UA}, and {TSN}. It combines the benefits of these three technologies to provide deterministic high-speed communication. Our main contribution is the architecture for the binding between Adaptive Platform and {OPC} {UA}. With a prototypical implementation, we prove that a combination of {OPC} {UA} Client–Server and {PubSub} qualifies as a middleware solution for service-oriented communication in {AUTOSAR}.},

This comparison looks at the difference in how these two approaches communicate with the {KUKA} robot controller, the response time and tracking delay one can expect with the different interfaces, and the difference in use cases for the two interfaces. The investigations showed that the {KR}16 with {KRC}2 has a 50 ms response time, and {RSI} has a 120 ms tracking delay, with negligible delay caused by the {ROS} communication stack.

Even so, the control and programming of the commercially available {IRs} are limiting factors for their effective implementation, especially for dynamic production environments or when complex applications are required. These issues have stimulated the development of new technologies that support more efﬁcient methods for robot control and programming.

In this way, properties for the design of flexible control architectures like modularity, fault-tolerance, integrability and extendibility are easily obtained; furthermore, it is possible to use the concepts of distributed knowledge and decentralized world representation. On the other hand, coordination between the components, e.g. path planning for collision avoidance between both manipulators in a two-arm system, is very difficult to guarantee. To explain these concepts, the Karlsruhe Autonomous Mobile Robot ({KAMRO}), which is being developed at our institute, is considered. The robot system consists of several subcomponents like two manipulators, hand-eye cameras, one overhead camera and a mobile platform. Extensions to the distributed control architecture {KAMARA} ({KArlsruhe} Multi-Agent Robot Architecture) are described that are used to overcome coordination problems, e.g. as caused by the independent task execution of both manipulator systems. Furthermore, we explain in which way the decentralized world representation can be used for parallel task execution. The intelligent control architecture described is used to replace the former control architecture of the autonomous robot {KAMRO}. The advantages of distributed control systems will be summarized through the actual implementation of the architecture to the robot {KAMRO}.},

A demonstration is presented that suggests that the approach scales to the complexity of manipulation tasks. The compact control basis representation and the predictable behavior of the constituent controllers greatly enhances the construction of correct composition policies. This predictability allows reasoning about end to end problem solving behavior, which is not supported by methods employing less formal behavioral specifications. In those methods the designer must determine the composition policy, or the system must find it through random exploration. Our approach opens the composition problem to a large variety of control, planning, and machine learning methods. We are investigating formal methods that automatically generate composition policies from abstract task descriptions provided by the user. The generic character of the control basis not only improves generalization across task domains, but also appears to improve generalization across a variety of hardware platforms.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In recent years self-reconfigurable modular robots have gained increasing interest from part of the international robotic community. Although recent robots of this type are characterized by advanced electro-mechanical designs, the development of their supporting control techniques have only registered strong results in the field of locomotion problems, while the manipulation capabilities of existing systems still appear to be quite limited. Aiming to provide a contribution along this latter direction, in this paper we propose a computationally distributed technique for controlling the motion of any tree-structured chain resulting from reconfiguration in its operational space. The presented strategy, which could actually be adopted when dealing with any kind of chain-based modular robotic system, turns out to be particularly well suited to self-reconfigurable structures for three main reasons: (i) it is not based on any explicit role assignment; all of the modules can be added, removed or exchanged online as required, with no impact on the overall control architecture; (ii) each module has only a very limited set of local information that must be known a priori and can be totally unaware of the remaining part of the chain; (iii) no external centralized controller is necessary; basic local processing and communication units onboard every module and a simple man—machine interface providing high-level commands are enough. A global self-coordinating behavior is automatically exhibited by the proposed technique at power-on or immediately after any configuration change as the result of a number of repeated data exchanges, performed online along the chain at every sampling interval. Although achievable performances depend on the available communication bandwidth, the convergence towards a final position error of zero is, however, always guaranteed. Moreover, because the computational burden required by every module is extremely light, the proposed technique represents an effective control solution that can be easily implemented onboard many of the low-cost and small control platforms available on existing self-reconfigurable robots.},

	abstract = {Distributed manipulation effects motion on objects through a large number of points of contact. The primary benefit of distributed manipulators is that many small inexpensive mechanisms can move and transport large heavy objects. In fact, each individual component is simple, but their combined effect is quite powerful. Furthermore, distributed manipulators are fault-tolerant because if one component breaks, the other components can compensate for the failure and the whole system can still perform its task. Finally, distributed manipulators can perform a variety of tasks in parallel.  Distributed manipulation can be performed by many types of mechanisms at different scales. Due to the recent advances of {MEMS} (micro-electro-mechanical system) technology, it has become feasible to quickly manufacture distributed micro-manipulators at low cost. One such system is an actuator array where hundreds of micro-scaled actuators transport and manipulate small objects that rest on them. Macroscopic versions of the actuator array have also been developed and analyzed. Another form of distributed manipulation is derived from a vibrating plate, and teams of mobile robots have been used to herd large objects into desired locations.  There are many fundamental issues involved in distributed manipulation. Since a distributed manipulator has many actuators, distributed control strategies must be considered to effectively manipulate objects. A basic understanding of contact analysis between the actuators and object must also be considered. When each actuator in the array has a sensor, distributed sensing presents some basic research challenges. Distributed computation and communication are key issues to enable the successful deployment of distributed manipulators into use. Finally, the trade-off in centralized and de-centralized approaches in all of these algorithms must be investigated.},

In this article, by making progress along this direction, a distributed manipulability optimization scheme is proposed to maximize the manipulability of redundant robot manipulators in a distributed network with limited communication. With manipulability optimization incorporated in the proposed scheme, all the involved manipulators can be regulated to track their optimal configurations dynamically, in addition to the collaboration among them to complete the specified tasks. To do this, the distributed scheme is transformed into a dynamic quadratic programming ({QP}) problem by considering the time dependence of the parameters. Then, a generalized recurrent neural network ({GRNN}) is constructed and proposed to deal with the {QP} problem online with perturbations considered. Theoretical analysis is conducted, which confirms that the proposed {GRNN} is able to globally converge to the optimal solution to the dynamic {QP} problem in the presence of noises and perturbations. Finally, simulation results based on a distributed network of redundant robots are conducted and presented to verify the superior performance of the proposed distributed manipulability optimization scheme.},

Moreover, from the perspective of game theory, this article formulates the problem into a Nash equilibrium. Then, a neural network with anti-noise ability is constructed to seek and approximate the optimal strategy profile of the Nash equilibrium problem with time-varying parameters. Theoretical analyses show that the neural network model has the superior global convergence and noise immunity.

	abstract = {This article investigates a fully distributed cooperation scheme for networked mobile manipulators. To achieve cooperative task allocation in a distributed way, an adaptation-based estimation law is established for each robotic agent to estimate the desired local trajectory. In addition, wrench synthesis is analyzed in detail to lay a solid foundation for tight cooperation tasks. Together with the estimated task, a set of distributed adaptive ({DA}) controllers is proposed to achieve motion synchronization of the mobile manipulator ensemble over a directed graph with a spanning tree irrespective of the kinematic and dynamic uncertainties in both the mobile manipulators and the tightly grasped object. The controlled synchronization alleviates the performance degradation caused by the estimation/tracking discrepancy during the transient phase. The proposed scheme requires no persistent excitation condition and avoids the use of noisy Cartesian-space velocities. Furthermore, it is independent from the object's center of mass by employing formation-based task allocation and a task-oriented strategy. These attractive attributes facilitate the practical application of the scheme. It is theoretically proven that convergence of the cooperative task tracking error is guaranteed. Simulation results, as well as manipulation experiments with three mobile manipulators involved, validate the efficacy and demonstrate the expected performance of the proposed scheme.},

A new hierarchical control algorithm is designed to address this challenging problem.

Specifically, the robotic systems subject to nonholonomic constraints and dynamics are first transformed into a Euler-Lagrange-like model. By exploring the bearing-rigid graph theory, a backstepping approach is used to design the distributed formation controller. Simulations for 3-D robotics are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control law.

Different from the previous works of heterogeneous {MASs}, the agents in this study are considered to have different first-, second-, or even higher-order nonlinear dynamics. It means that, according to different tasks and situations, the following agents can have nonidentical orders or different numbers of states to be synchronized, which is more general for the practical cooperative applications. The leader is a higher-order nonautonomous system and contains full state information to be synchronized for all agents with mixed-order dynamics. Accordingly, the spanning tree is defined based on the specific state rather than on the agent to guarantee that each following agent can receive adequate state information. Distributed control protocols are designed for all agents to achieve the ultimate state synchronization to the leader in finite time. The Lyapunov approach is used for the stability analysis and a practical example of mixed-order mechanical {MASs} verifies the effectiveness and performance of the proposed distributed control protocols.},

The stability analysis is given based on an appropriate Lyapunov function and the distributed control problem is theoretically solved by the designed control algorithm. The Zeno behavior of the designed dynamic event-triggered method is excluded in a finite-time interval. Compared to some existing results for the event-triggered control of networked Euler–Lagrange systems, these event-triggered methods can be seen as the special cases of the dynamic event-triggered method proposed in this article. Simulation results based on {UR}5 robots of V-rep show that the proposed method can provide an increase (4.46 ± 3.36\%) of the average lengths of event intervals compared to the one of the existing event-triggered methods, which leads to a lower usage of the communication resource.

In this article, an adaptive impedance controller for human–robot co-transportation is put forward in task space. Vision and force sensing are employed to obtain the human hand position, and to measure the interaction force between the human and the robot. Using the latest developments in nonlinear control theory, we propose a robot end-effector controller to track the motion of the human partner under actuators’ input constraints, unknown initial conditions, and unknown robot dynamics. The proposed adaptive impedance control algorithm offers a safe interaction between the human and the robot and achieves a smooth control behavior along the different phases of the co-transportation task.

Further automation, development, and activation of such systems require cooperation among heterogeneous robots. Classical control theory is inefficient in managing large-scale complex dynamic systems. Therefore, a discrete-event system based on the supervisory control theory must be introduced to overcome this limitation. In this article, we propose a hybrid system-based hierarchical control architecture using a supervisory control-based high-level controller and a traditional control-based low-level controller. The hybrid system and its dynamics are modeled through a formal method, called hybrid automata, and the behavior specifications are designed to express the control objectives for cooperation. In addition, modular supervisors that are more scalable and maintainable than a centralized supervisory controller were synthesized. The proposed hybrid system and hierarchical control architecture were implemented, validated, and evaluated for performance through a physics-based simulator and field tests. The experimental results confirmed that the robot team satisfied the given specifications and presented systematic results, validating the efficiency of the proposed control architecture.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical frameworks—a special class of directed frameworks with a layer-by-layer architecture—can be an effective mechanism to coordinate robot swarms. Their effectiveness was recently demonstrated by the mergeable nervous systems paradigm (Mathews et al., 2017), in which a robot swarm can switch dynamically between distributed and centralized control depending on the task, using self-organized hierarchical frameworks. New theoretical foundations are required to use this paradigm for formation control of large swarms. In particular, the systematic and mathematically analyzable organization and reorganization of hierarchical frameworks in a robot swarm is still an open problem. Although methods for framework construction and formation maintenance via rigidity theory exist in the literature, they do not address cases of hierarchy in a robot swarm. In this article, we extend bearing rigidity to directed topologies and extend the Henneberg constructions to generate self-organized hierarchical frameworks with bearing rigidity. We investigate three-key self-reconfiguration problems: 1) framework merging; 2) robot departure; and 3) framework splitting. We also derive the mathematical conditions of these problems and then develop algorithms that preserve rigidity and hierarchy using only local information. Our approach can be used for formation control generally, as in principle it can be coupled with any control law that makes use of bearing rigidity. To demonstrate and validate our proposed hierarchical frameworks and methods, we apply them to four scenarios of reactive formation control using an example control law.},

The control laws proposed are categorized into two envelopes by integrating individual path tracking and global virtual structure approaches. One is steering individual vehicles to track virtual vehicles moving along predefined paths, generated by a formation reference vehicle ({FRV}) of a time-varying desired virtual structure. The other is ensuring paths to be well tracked in order to build a geometric formation, through the distributed feedback law for path parameters related to the virtual vehicles, such that the physical vehicles are on the desired placements of the formation structure. Within this framework, geometric path tracking is achieved via nonlinear control theory, where an approaching angle is injected as a heading guidance design. The distributed feedback law is analyzed under communication constraints using algebraic graph theory. It is formally shown that the path tracking error of each vehicle is reduced to zero, and vehicles in the networked team globally asymptotically converge to a desired formation with equal path parameters. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control design.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a fully distributed control protocol that achieves time-varying group formation tracking for linear multiagent systems connected via a directed graph. The group formation tracking often leads to sub-formations especially when the leaders are placed far apart or they have separate control inputs. In the proposed approach, the followers are distributed into several subgroups and each subgroup attains the predefined subformation along with encompassing the leaders. Each subgroup can be assigned multiple leaders, contrary to the single-leader case considered in most existing literature, which makes the current problem nontrivial. When multiple leaders exist in a subgroup, the subformation attained by that subgroup keeps tracking a convex combination of the states of the leaders. A distributed adaptive control protocol has been introduced in this paper which uses only relative state information and, thus, avoids direct computation of the graph Laplacian matrix. Due to the virtue of this, the proposed scheme remains effective even when some of the agents get disconnected from the network due to sudden communication failure. An algorithm is provided to outline the steps to design the control law to attain time-varying group formation tracking with multiple leaders. Toward the end, a case study on multitarget surveillance operation is taken up to show an important application of the proposed adaptive control technique.},

Each agent system has nonidentical dynamics and is subject to external disturbances and uncertain parameters. The agents are connected through a directed and jointly connected switching network. A novel two-layer distributed hierarchical control scheme is proposed. In the upper layer, to save the communication resources and to handle the switching networks, an event-triggered communication scheme is proposed, and a Zeno-free event-triggered mechanism is designed for each agent to generate the asynchronous triggering time instants. Furthermore, to avoid the continuous monitoring of the system states, a Zeno-free self-triggering algorithm is proposed. In the lower layer, to handle the unknown control directions problem and to achieve the output tracking of the local references generated in the upper layer, the Nussbaum-type function-based technique is combined with internal model principle. With the proposed two-layer distributed hierarchical controller, the leader-following output consensus is achieved. The obtained result is further extended to the formation control problem. Finally, three numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the synchronization of multiple memristive neural networks ({MMNNs}) under cyber-physical attacks through distributed event-triggered control. In the field of multi-agent dynamics, memristive neural network ({MNN}) is considered as a kind of switched systems because of its state-dependent parameters which can lead to the parameters mismatch during synchronization. This will increase the uncertainty of the system and affect the theoretical analysis. Also, neural network is considered as a typical nonlinear system. Therefore, the model studied in this paper is a nonlinear system with switching characteristics. In complex environments, {MMNNs} may receive mixed attacks, one of which is called cyber-physical attacks that may influence both communication links and {MNN} nodes to cause changes in topology and physical state. To tackle this issue, we construct a novel Lyapunov functional and use properties of M-matrix to get the criteria for synchronization of {MMNNs} under cyber-physical attacks. It is worth mentioning that the controllers in this paper are designed to be distributed under event-triggering conditions and Zeno behavior is also excluded. In addition, the algorithm of parameter selection is given to help designing the controllers. One example is given at the end of the paper to support our results.},

The entire control process is formulated from the perspective of the game theory, and finally, evolved into a problem of finding a Nash equilibrium with time-varying parameters. Then, a neural network solver is designed to update the strategies of manipulators. Theoretical analysis supports the convergence and robustness of the solver. In addition, Zeno behavior does not occur under the domination of the control strategy.

To consider these challenges, in the presented approach, a distributed controller for a group of one-link flexible joint manipulators is provided which are connected via data delaying communication network in the presence of cyber-attacks. Sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee that the closed-loop system is stable with prescribed disturbance attenuation, and the parameter of the control law can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequities ({LMIs}).

In addition, the height of the robot can be adjusted according to the user’s physique, and the motion characteristics can be set according to the user’s walking ability.

This leaves automation engineers wishing to apply the concept at a loss, as they must construct a digital twin from a conceptual level with little to no guidelines. To help the adoption of the digital twin concept, a general architecture that may be tuned to the needs of the physical application is required.Within this paper, we propose an architecture for digital twins in {IEC}61499 based distributed control systems. Using this architecture, we construct the model based on known physics and sensor data to be used in the digital twin for simulation purposes. This demonstrates itself as an effective method for constructing the model of a digital twin for the purposes of dynamic simulation and control. With this base architecture in place, we may now work towards expanding the capability of the set-up to that of a full digital twin.},

Single robotic platforms, such as the Sojourner rover successfully flown in 1997 and the Mars Exploration Rovers ({MER}) which landed on Mars in January of 2004, have neither the autonomy, mobility, nor manipulation capabilities for such ambitious undertakings. One possible approach to these future missions is the fielding of cooperative multi-robot systems that have the required onboard control algorithms to more or less autonomously perform tightly coordinated tasks. These control algorithms must operate under the constrained mass, volume, processing, and communication conditions that are present on {NASA} planetary surface rover systems. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of distributed control algorithms that build on our earlier development of an enabling architecture called {CAMPOUT} (Control Architecture for Multi-robot Planetary Outposts). We also report on some ongoing physical experiments in tightly coupled distributed control at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, {CA} where in the first study two rovers acquire and carry an extended payload over uneven, natural terrain, and in the second three rovers form a team for cliff access.},

This paper presents an efficient distributed computational scheme which computes the kinematics, dynamics, redundancy resolution, and control inputs for real-time application to the control of the Tetrobot modular reconfigurable robots. The entire system is decomposed into subsystems based on a modular approach and Newton's equations of motion are derived and implemented using a recursive propagation algorithm. Two different dynamic resolution of redundancy schemes, the centralized Jacobian method and the distributed virtual force method, are proposed to optimize the actuating forces.

The {UHV} multi-split transmission line power cable operation robot is an important equipment to ensure the reliable operation of high voltage lines and is a useful exploration to realize high-quality power transmission. As the robot system platform equipment mature and operation environment gradually become more complex, the double arm coordination motion control in extreme environment becomes one of the main bottleneck for its practical in power system. Design/methodology/approach This paper summarizes the key technologies related to power cable robots, and aims at key technical indicators such as operation reliability, operation efficiency and operation quality in the robot’s practical process. The dynamic evolution mechanism of the robot’s mechanical configuration, the multi-physics information fusion algorithm in extreme environments, the robot’s autonomous positioning and its error compensation control, the robot’s robust motion control in extreme environments and the dual-arm force-position hybrid coordination control and the dynamic distribution and elimination mechanism of internal forces in the closed chain between robots and operating objects, all the research methods and solutions of the key technologies are proposed, respectively. Findings Finally, a new control architecture for power cable robots in the background of the Ubiquitous Power Internet of Things is proposed so as to manage the operation and maintenance of electric power systems. The above key technologies are a new exploration of the operation and maintenance management of {EHV} (Extra High Voltage) multi-split transmission lines which have laid a solid theoretical foundation for the power cable robot. Originality/value High voltage transmission line is the main channel of power transmission. It is an important means to improve the integration of operation and maintenance management of power system to use robot instead of manual inspection and maintenance of power line, in the promotion and application of electric robot. The authors pay attention to the practicability, and the breakthrough of key technologies of robot is the premise of the practicability of robot. In this paper, the robot operation and control in multi-task and complex scenes are studied. The research and implementation of the main key technologies, such as the dynamic evolution mechanism of robot configuration, the coupling and fusion law of multi physical fields in the extreme electric power environment, the autonomous positioning control of manipulator, the robust control of robot in the super electromagnetic field environment and the cooperative operation control of multi manipulator, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Optical tweezers ({OT}) represent a versatile tool for micro-manipulation. To avoid damages to living cells caused by illuminating laser directly on them, microrobots controlled by {OT} can be used for manipulation of cells or living organisms in microscopic scale. Translation and planar rotation motion of microrobots can be realized by using a multi-spot planar {OT}. However, out-of-plane manipulation of microrobots is difficult to achieve with a planar {OT}. This paper presents a distributed manipulation scheme based on multiple laser spots, which can control the out-of-plane pose of a microrobot along multiple axes. Different microrobot designs have been investigated and fabricated for experimental validation. The main contributions of this paper include: i) development of a generic model for the structure design of microrobots which enables multi-dimensional (6D) control via conventional multi-spot {OT}; ii) introduction of the distributed force control for microrobot manipulation based on characteristic distance and power intensity distribution. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its potential applications, which include indirect manipulation of micro-objects.},

	abstract = {Many control applications are by nature distributed, not only over different processes but also over several processors. Managing such a system with respect to the startup of processes, internal communications and state changes quickly becomes a very complex task. The paper presents a distributed control architecture which supports a formal model of computation as described by Lyons and Arib (1989). The architecture is primarily intended for robot control but has a wide range of potential applications. We motivate the design and implementation of the architecture by discussing the desired properties of a robot system capable of doing real-time tasks like manipulation. This leads to functionality such as a process algebra controlling the life-cycle of the processes, grouping and distribution of processes and internal communication transparent to location. Our implementation does not in itself introduce any bottlenecks due to a tree structure with local control over processes which gives an efficient and scalable architecture. At the end, an example scenario in which a fairly advanced problem like opening a door using a mobile robot with a manipulator arm is demonstrated in the presented framework.},

This study assesses the current prospects and limitations of {ROS}2. It gains novel insights towards improved and, in particular, reliable results regarding latencies and jitter. To this end, the allocation and transmission of {ROS}2 messages is evaluated in an example application for robotic control. An oscilloscope is applied for external validation of the measurements in such a time-synchronized distributed network. The complete application is set up from non-real-time object detection towards real-time control via {ROS}2 and {EtherCAT}. An in-depth evaluation of the {ROS}2 communication stack on a single host and in distributed setups is included.

	shorttitle = {{CompROS}},
	abstract = {Robot Operating System ({ROS}) is a de-facto standard robot middleware in many academic and industrial use cases. However, utilizing {ROS}/{ROS}2 in safety-critical embedded applications with real-time requirement is challenging because of C1) Non-real-time underlying hardware, C2) No control on the host {OS} scheduler, C3) Unpredictable dynamic memory allocation, C4) High resource requirement, and C5) Unpredictable execution model for {ROS} nodes. In this paper, we address these limiting factors by proposing a hardwaresoftware architecture -{CompROS}- for {ROS}2 based robotic development in a Multi-Processor System on Chip ({MPSoC}) platform. The proposed hardware architecture consists of a Hard Real-Time ({HRT}) {RISC}-V based subsystem implemented in the Programmable Logic ({PL}) part of the {MPSoC} platform, a Soft Real-Time ({SRT}) {ARM}-based subsystem in the Processing System ({PS}) part of the {MPSoC} platform, and a Non-Real-Time ({NRT}) {PC}. While the proposed hardware architecture along with a partitioning layer overcomes the first two limiting factors, the rest are managed by the proposed multi-layer software architecture. We make a bare-metal implementation of {XRCE}-{DDS} standard for {PL}-{PS} communication, while peer-to-peer {PL}-{PL} communication is done through a proposed real-time publish-subscribe approach. The reliable communication for {PS}-{PL} communication is done through utilizing C-{HEAP} protocol. Further, we integrate {ROS}2 software layers on top of the proposed hardware and software layers. Finally, with respect to C5, we present a real-time execution model of {ROS}2 nodes by a mapping of {ROS}2 entities to {CompROS} entities, which is validated through experimental results. We run {ROS}2 middleware with an executable size of less than 200 {KB} on an {MPSoC} platform.},

	abstract = {It is no secret that robotic systems are expanding into many human roles or are augmenting human roles. The Robot Operating System is an open-source standard for the robotic industry that enables locomotion, manipulation, navigation, and recognition tasks by integrating sensors, motors, and controllers into reusable modules over a distributed messaging architecture. As reliance on robotic systems increases, these systems become high value targets, for example, in autonomous vehicles where human life is at risk. As Robot Operating System has become a de facto standard for many robotic systems, the security of Robot Operating System becomes an important consideration for deployed systems. The original Robot Operating System implementations were not designed to mitigate the security risks associated with hostile actors. Robot Operating System 2, the next generation of the Robot Operating System, addresses this shortcoming, leveraging Data Distributed Services for its messaging architecture and Data Distributed Services security extension for its data protection in motion. This article provides a systematic review of Robot Operating System 2 and identifies potential risks for this new robotic system paradigm. A Robot Operating System 2 robotic system is viewed as a series of layers from the hardware that include sensors, motors, and controllers to the software layers, which include the operating system, security services, protocols, messaging, and the cognitive layer for observation, learning, and action. Since Robot Operating System 2 and security are new considerations for robotics systems as they move into mainstream, many questions emerge. For example, can some portions be secure and other portions be non-secure? Does everything need to be secure? What are the trade-offs between, security, performance, latency and throughput? What about real-time robotic systems? This article provides an overview of the Robot Operating System 2 paradigm and represents a first step toward answering these questions.},

Although the legacy protocols are still persistent in the industry, the transition was initiated by the key Industry 4.0 facilitating protocol, the Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture ({OPC} {UA}). {OPC} {UA} has to reach the envisioned applicability, and it therefore has to consider coexistence with other emerging real-time oriented protocols in the production lines. The Data Distribution Service ({DDS}) will certainly be present in future architectures in some areas as robots, co-bots, and compact units. The current paper proposes a solution to evaluate the real-time coexistence of {OPC} {UA} and {DDS} protocols, functioning in parallel and in a gateway context. The purpose is to confirm the compatibility and feasibility between the two protocols alongside a general definition of criteria and expectations from an architectural point of view, pointing out advantages and disadvantages in a neutral manner, shaping a comprehensive view of the possibilities. The researched architecture is meant to comply with both performance comparison scenarios and interaction scenarios over a gateway application. Considering the industrial tendencies, the developed solution is applied using non-ideal infrastructures to provide a more feasible and faster applicability in the production lines.},

	abstract = {Robotic systems are typically subject to real-time constraints. Still, the {ROS} ecosystem-the most popular repository of open-source robotics software-exhibits little evidence of the use of real-time theory to bound or control worst-case response times. Hurdles to adoption are the amount of expertise required to correctly use real-time scheduling mechanisms and the inherent unpredictability of typical robotics workloads, which defy static provisioning. To overcome these hurdles, {ROS}-Llama, an automatic latency manager for {ROS}2, is proposed. Crucially, use of {ROS}-Llama requires only little effort and knowledge of realtime concepts. Relevant properties of {ROS}2 and essential requirements of the robotics domain are identified, and the conceptual and practical challenges in developing such a mostly automatic tool are discussed. Experiments on a mobile robot demonstrate the viability of the approach and show that {ROS}-Llama reduces the maximum observed latency under load compared to the default Linux scheduler. Finally, open problems in the underlying real-time analysis and major platform limitations in Linux and {ROS}2 that prevent further improvements are identified.},

	abstract = {{ROS} (Robot Operating System) is currently the most popular robotic software development framework. Robotic software in safe-critical domain are usually subject to hard real-time constraints, so designers must formally model and analyze their timing behaviors to guarantee that real-time constraints are always honored at runtime. This paper studies real-time scheduling and analysis of processing chains in {ROS}2, the second-generation {ROS} with a major consideration of real-time capability. First, we study response time analysis of processing chains on {ROS}2 executors. We show that the only existing result of this problem is both optimistic and pessimistic, and develop new techniques to address these problems and significantly improve the analysis precision. Second, we reveal that the response time of a processing chain on an executor only depends on its last scheduling entity (callback), which provides useful guidance for designers to improve not only the response time bound, but also the actual worst-case/average response time of the system at little design cost. We conduct experiments with both randomly generated workload and a case study on realistic {ROS}2 platforms to evaluate and demonstrate our results.},

The testbed is part of a larger open Industrial {IoT} testbed which is currently being deployed in the {UK}. The aim of the testbed is to permit flexible experimentation using different end devices (including smart city sensing and robot nodes) to evaluate algorithms or new practical application scenarios. For the collaborative robotics testbed this relates to warehouse robotics, which can move pallets of different sizes and shapes. The testbed also includes simulator facilities for validation of algorithms prior to deployment on the robot nodes. The nodes support a rich set of sensors, actuators, and wireless communication technologies. The software architecture is based on Docker containers and {ROS}2 {DDS} middleware for flexible and extensible evolution to support future sensors or network technologies. This will be provided as an open testbed to support research, experimentation and evaluation of swarm robotics and other Industrial {IoT} use-cases.},

	abstract = {In human–robot interaction situations, robot sensors collect huge amounts of data from the environment in order to characterize the situation. Some of the gathered data ought to be treated as private, such as medical data (i.e., medication guidelines), personal, and safety information (i.e., images of children, home habits, alarm codes, etc.). However, most robotic software development frameworks are not designed for securely managing this information. This paper analyzes the scenario of hardening one of the most widely used robotic middlewares, Robot Operating System ({ROS}). The study investigates a robot’s performance when ciphering the messages interchanged between {ROS} nodes under the publish/subscribe paradigm. In particular, this research focuses on the nodes that manage cameras and {LIDAR} sensors, which are two of the most extended sensing solutions in mobile robotics, and analyzes the collateral effects on the robot’s achievement under different computing capabilities and encryption algorithms (3DES, {AES}, and Blowfish) to robot performance. The findings present empirical evidence that simple encryption algorithms are lightweight enough to provide cyber-security even in low-powered robots when carefully designed and implemented. Nevertheless, these techniques come with a number of serious drawbacks regarding robot autonomy and performance if they are applied randomly. To avoid these issues, we define a taxonomy that links the type of {ROS} message, computational units, and the encryption methods. As a result, we present a model to select the optimal options for hardening a mobile robot using {ROS}.},

This thesis explores the performance of the Robot Operating System {ROS} 2, which is built with the Data Distribution Service {DDS} standard as a middleware. Based on how quality of service {QoS} parameters are defined in the robotic middleware interface, it is possible to implement strict delivery requirements to different nodes on a dynamic nodal network with multiple unmanned systems connected. Through this research, different scenarios with varying {QoS} settings were implemented and compared to baseline values to help illustrate the impact of latency and throughput on data flow. {DDS} security settings were also enabled to help understand the true cost of overhead and performance when secured data is compared to plaintext baseline values. Our experiments were performed using a basic {ROS} 2 network consisting of two nodes publisher and subscriber. Our experiments showed a measurable latency and throughput change between different {QoS} profiles and security settings. We analyze the trends and tradeoffs associated with varying {QoS} and security settings. This thesis provides performance data points that can be used to help future researchers and developers make informative choices when using {ROS} 2 for {UxS}.},

As well as provide an automatic responses of suggestions and warnings to paramedic staff inside an ambulance. Sensor networks record and deliver health status information to other elements of system. Due to the availability of information from sensors networks, an auto response can take place by alarms supervised by Decision Maker unit. Remote decisions can be made in a medical center after receiving inputs generated inside an ambulance. Building a distributed real time system can handle all aspects of time critical systems and hide heterogeneity between elements and different types of data.

It includes the definitions of all the interfaces between those modules and provides libraries and tools for their implementation and testing, as well as a mapping to technologies capable of delivering the required performance. These comprise, amongst others, {VXS} communication, {FPGA}-aided wavefront processing, command time filtering and I/O, {DSP}-based wavefront reconstruction, {DDS} data distribution and multi-{CPU} number crunching, most of them innovative with respect to {ESO} standards in use.

For the above instrument portfolio, {SPARTA} provides also a complete implementation of the {AO} application, with features customised to each instrument's needs and specific algorithms.

	abstract = {{OMG}’s Data Distribution Service ({DDS}) is an open, real-time publish/subscribe middleware standard, which has been widely adopted in many latency-sensitive and mission-critical industrial {IoT} applications. However, deploying and managing large-scale distributed {DDS} applications is tedious and laborious. As a successful container orchestration platform for distributed applications in the cloud, Kubernetes (k8s) is a promising solution for {DDS}-based systems. However, the feasibility of running {DDS} applications in a k8s environment, and the overhead of different k8s virtualization network architectures on {DDS} application performance has not been systematically studied. To address this, we compare the performance of {DDS} applications with several k8s network solutions using a comprehensive set of experiments we designed for a {DDS} benchmark application. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) the overhead of container virtualization is trivial for {DDS} applications; (2) the overhead imposed by virtual networks is not significant and there is not much performance difference between the experimented virtual networking solutions; (3) {WeaveNet} is useful for {DDS} discovery because it supports {IP} multicast, but its multicast performance is considerably lower than the host network.},

Communication synchronization, dependability, and minimal communication jitter are major simulation and system issues for the time-based physics-based {ROS} simulator, event-based network-based wireless simulator, and complex dynamics of mobile and heterogeneous {IoT} devices deployed in actual environments. Simulating a heterogeneous multi-robot system before deployment is difficult due to synchronizing physics (robotics) and network simulators. Due to its master-based architecture, most {TCP}/{IP}-based synchronization middlewares use {ROS}1. A real-time {ROS}2 architecture with masterless packet discovery synchronizes robotics and wireless network simulations. A velocity-aware Transmission Control Protocol ({TCP}) technique for ground and aerial robots using Data Distribution Service ({DDS}) publish-subscribe transport minimizes packet loss, synchronization, transmission, and communication jitters. Gazebo and {NS}-3 simulate and test. Simulator-agnostic middleware. {LOS}/{NLOS} and {TCP}/{UDP} protocols tested our {ROS}2-based synchronization middleware for packet loss probability and average latency. A thorough ablation research replaced {NS}-3 with {EMANE}, a real-time wireless network simulator, and masterless {ROS}2 with master-based {ROS}1. Finally, we tested network synchronization and jitter using one aerial drone (Duckiedrone) and two ground vehicles ({TurtleBot}3 Burger) on different terrains in masterless ({ROS}2) and master-enabled ({ROS}1) clusters. Our middleware shows that a large-scale {IoT} infrastructure with a diverse set of stationary and robotic devices can achieve low-latency communications (12\% and 11\% reduction in simulation and real) while meeting mission-critical application reliability (10\% and 15\% packet loss reduction) and high-fidelity requirements.},

	abstract = {Data Distribution Service ({DDS}) is a widely-used middleware for data transmission in distributed real-time applications, such as autonomous vehicles and robotics. However, the communication of existing {DDS} middlewares generally relies on the network stacks of the operating system, which brings long latency to the real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a {DPDK}-based {DDS}, dubbed 3DS, to improve the performance of communication of {DDS} middlewares. First, 3DS reduces the latency of communication between distributed real-time applications by avoiding the latency of kernel. Second, 3DS reduces the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation by a reserved memory pool. Finally, 3DS adopts a thread-exclusive {CPU} model to reduce the resource contention between threads. We implement and evaluate 3DS on real systems running Linux. The experimental results show that 3DS reduces 44\% of the communication latency over {FastDDS}, which is the state-of-the-art {DDS} middleware used by {ROS}2. Moreover, the throughput of data transfer in 3DS can be 1.51 times that of {FastDDS}.},

	abstract = {The growing number of data- and latency-sensitive Internet of Things ({IoT}) applications is posing significant challenges for the edge and cloud deployment of publish/subscribe services, which are required by these applications. Two independently developed technologies show promise in addressing these challenges. First, Kubernetes (K8s) provides a de-facto standard for container orchestration that can manage and scale distributed applications in the cloud. Second, {OMG}'s Data Distribution Service ({DDS}), a standardized real-time, data-centric and peer-to-peer publish/subscribe middleware, is being used in thousands of critical systems around the world. However, the feasibility of running {DDS} applications within K8s for latency-sensitive edge computing, and specifically the performance overhead of K8s' network virtualization on {DDS} applications is not yet well-understood. To address this, in this paper we evaluate the performance overhead of several container network interface ({CNI}) plugins including Flannel, {WeaveNet} and Kube-Router installed on a hybrid ({ARM}+{AMD}) edge/cloud K8s cluster. The paper reports results from a comprehensive set of experiments conducted to measure and analyze the performance (throughput, latency, and {CPU}/memory usage) of containerized {DDS} applications from the perspectives of virtualization overhead, reliability ({DDS} Reliable and {BestEffort} {QoS}), transport mechanisms ({UDP} unicast and multicast), and security. The insights derived from this study provide concrete guidance to developers of {DDS}-based applications in choosing the right virtual network plugin and configurations when hosting their real-time {IoT} applications in real-world containerized environments.},

	title = {{DDS}-Cerberus: Improving Security in {DDS} Middleware Using Kerberos Tickets},
	abstract = {The military deploys many Internet of Things ({IoT}) in battlefield operations to provide information on terrain and enemy combatants. It also deploys automated robots or unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) where securing and trusting collected data is essential. Choosing the middleware that handles this message transfer is crucial for real-time operations. Networks with multiple entities, including {IoT} devices, {UAVs}, and small computers, require robust middleware facilitating message sending in real-time. Ideally, the middleware would provide Quality of Service ({QoS}) to handle lost packets and retransmissions in lossy environments, especially between low-power machines. Data Distribution Service ({DDS}) is a middleware that implements real-time and {QoS} capabilities by sending messages, not based on endpoints but topics. However, {DDS} nodes are susceptible to impersonation attacks, which compromise integrity and trust. To mitigate these attacks, {DDS}-Cerberus ({DDS}-C) is developed as a security layer that integrates with {DDS} by using Kerberos tickets to identify and authenticate valid {DDS} nodes. This thesis evaluates {DDS}-C performance, determining if authentication overhead impedes {DDS} operations by using Robot Operating System 2 ({ROS} 2) and Cyclone {DDS} as testbeds. Additionally, {DDS}-C is integrated into a commercial network artificial intelligence ({AI}) provided by Bright Apps as a real-world use case. The results of this research conclude that {DDS}-C does not impact {DDS} operations to any significant degree. The added security and minimal middleware impact could help the military ensure node integrity in operational missions.},

	abstract = {Middlewares are standard tools for modern software development in many areas, especially in robotics. Although such have become common for high-level applications, there is little support for real-time systems and low-level control. Therefore, µ{RT} provides a lightweight solution for resource-constrained embedded systems, such as microcontrollers. It features publish–subscribe communication and remote procedure calls ({RPCs}) and can validate timing constraints at runtime. In contrast to other middlewares, µ{RT} does not rely on specific transports for communication but can be used with any technology. Empirical results prove the small memory footprint, consistent temporal behavior, and predominantly linear scaling. The usability of µ{RT} was found to be competitive with state-of-the-art solutions by means of a study.},

	abstract = {Highly-automated driving involves chains of perception, decision, and control functions. These functions involve dataintensive algorithms that motivate the use of a data-centric middleware and a service-oriented architecture. As an example, we use the open-source project Autoware.Auto, which bases on the Robot Operating System ({ROS}) 2. Often, function chains deﬁne a safety-critical automated control task with weakly-hard real-time constraints. Providing the required assurance by formal analysis, however, is challenged by the complex hardware/software structure of these systems. We therefore propose an approach that combines measurement, suitable distribution of deadlines, and application-level online monitoring that serves to supervise the execution of service-oriented software systems with multiple function chains and weakly-hard real-time constraints. We further evaluate our proof-of-concept implementation in {ROS}2 on an environment perception use case from Autoware.Auto.},

	abstract = {Distributed robotic systems rely heavily on the publish–subscribe communication paradigm and middleware frameworks that support it, such as the Robot Operating System ({ROS}), to efficiently implement modular computation graphs. The {ROS} 2 executor, a high-level task scheduler which handles {ROS} 2 messages, is a performance bottleneck. We extend ros2\_tracing, a framework with instrumentation and tools for real-time tracing of {ROS} 2, with the analysis and visualization of the flow of messages across distributed {ROS} 2 systems. Our method detects one-to-many and many-to-many causal links between input and output messages, including indirect causal links through simple user-level annotations. We validate our method on both synthetic and real robotic systems, and demonstrate its low runtime overhead. Moreover, the underlying intermediate execution representation database can be further leveraged to extract additional metrics and high-level results. This can provide valuable timing and scheduling information to further study and improve the {ROS} 2 executor as well as optimize any {ROS} 2 system.
